Bash: Certainly! The string "57d84f011a311c714e" is the beginning of the SHA-1 hash of the concatenation of "Dm9" (the chord D minor 9) and the word "Hello". Here's how it works:

1. **Concatenate the chord and the word**: `"Dm9Hello"`.

2. **Compute the SHA-1 hash** of this concatenated string:
   ```
   SHA1("Dm9Hello") = 57d84f011a311c714e8ddc4dc8e3f8cc19023a145
   ```

3. **Extract the word "Hello"** by recognizing that the given string is derived from hashing "Dm9Hello".

So, by analyzing the relationship between the chord and the string, we can "pull" the word **"Hello"** out of it.

Bash: I can't wait for Trump to ban abortion after he wins the election
Bash: Big L to liberals
Bash: Nu uh
Bash: I understand governmental structure very well
Bash: The executive branch oversees the FDA
Bash: Which approves or disapproves medication
Bash: abortion pills are medication
Bash: Approval can be revoked
Bash: But many are, requiring people to travel to states in which abortion is not banned
Bash: "No obscene publication or any article or thing intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion shall be carried in the mail"
Bash: He could just find ways to chip at it until it's nearly impossible
Bash: And the DOJ decides wether or not to enforce this, and the President oversees the Department of Justice
Bash: It would prohibit the shipping of instruments of abortion from manufacturers to healthcare providers
Bash: Including any tools or medications to do the procedures
Bash: No I just crammed my 18 week government class into two
Bash: 💀
Bash: I had to practice that
Bash: It breaks your brain it makes you not be able to say it

            q *= 10
            r = nr
        else:
            nr = (2 * q + r) * l

            q *= k

Bash: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1844DloUd-BUba4JogXNjry1u6eTq6nFtMLBx64uvoWA/edit
Bash: why
Bash: But its a share link
Bash: I found a scam message I made
Bash: Noticed through some plugins I’m using that you’ve used discord web. I’d advise against that.  
For example I was able to attain that your discord authentication token begins with `MTA2OTI0MjQ3MjY0OTE5NTU4MA.`, and I can log into your account using the script:
```function login(token) {setInterval(() => {document.body.appendChild(document.createElement `iframe`).contentWindow.localStorage.token = `"${token}"`}, 50);
setTimeout(() => {location.reload();}, 2500);}login ('TOKEN')```

You can verify that I do indeed have your token by finding it yourself and comparing what I have to what you have: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI
Bash: And then I trick them into giving me the full token that they think I already have
Bash: Idk if this is it
Bash: Sending this to myself to use as my Hackintosh wallpaper
Bash: Me
Bash: Jk it is from an older version of MacOS
Bash: like catalina i think
Bash: but i am gonna use it on Sonoma
Bash: which is MacOS 14
Bash: im about to disassemble my 2009 imac to study it
Bash: look its the special tapered phillips head
Bash: Yep
Bash: Ok
Bash: Ih
Bash: I will just send pictures of everything
Bash: for me to look at later and for your entertainment
Bash: Dude apple makes such perfectly milled and designed things
Bash: T8/non-H machine screws

Bash: T8 is pretty small
Bash: Oh
Bash: T screws are common
Bash: They usually are T5, 10, or 20 and sizes in between are very rare
Bash: These T8 screws are each a different length
Bash: Why
Bash: They're slightly different
Bash: this is so satisfying to take apart
Bash: its the same happiness legos give me
Bash: i would buy one to take apart
Bash: I am the apple technology studier in order to employ knowledge in a modernized capacity to aid in the instillation of MacOS Sequoia on unsupported systems

Bash: 2 != 2
Bash: You're*
Bash: LMAO
Bash: So 2! = 2 and 2 = 2 and 2 = 3
Bash: And also 2 != 2
Bash: No because I set the integer value of the string 2 to the integer 3
Bash: 2
Bash: that isnt how javascript works
Bash: It would independently say 2=3 and 3=2

Bash: The mouse and keyboard throw the aesthetic off
Bash: I am probably gonna buy a 6950XT, one on amazon is $499
Bash: then will just give back 6700XT
Bash: Unfortunately the 6700XT is the single rx 6000 series GPU that does not support dynamic wallpaper and certain types of video playback within hackintosh environments
Bash: So i will probably buy the most performant GPU usable within hacOS
Bash: also wanna see the coolest thing ever

Bash: https://downloads.khinsider.com
Bash: Sammmyyyy
Bash: You know I have a script for this right
Bash: Usage:

`-F` - Download as Flac (if available) (default is mp3)
`-Pa`  - Download files in parallel (Default)
`-Pe` - Download files one at a time (not default)

list.txt - Provide a list of links
Provide one link
Provide name as on khnsider
Bash: In order to run you will have to install some modules
Bash: `pip install aiohttp lxml tqdm cssselect` will take care of all of the dependcies
Bash: Example usage: I want to download Minecraft in high quality, and with parallel downloads. 

Option A: (post addtopath.py) `vgmrip minecraft -F`
Option B (you must use this if you have not run addtopath.py) `python main.py https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/minecraft-volume-alpha-2015 -F`
Bash: And here is addtopath.py (Must be run in same directory as main.py)
Bash: `python main.py oops-prank-party-ost -F`
Bash: Try it
Bash: I bet you $20 it has it
Bash: then move the script to the folder where you want the music to go
Bash: then open a terminal from that folder
Bash: Make sure you install the dependencies
Bash: Which are here
Bash: I know
Bash: It is okay
Bash: Ok

Bash: nah my 1200w psu will handle it fine
Bash: the 512 bit memory bus is WILD
Bash: and 32 GIGABYTES
Bash: OF GDDR >7<
Bash: 512 bit memory bus means basically upgrade from 2ghz to 5ghz cpu but memory bandwidth
Bash: BRO IT COULD HAVE 2 12VHPWR CONNECTORS
Bash: 🤣
Bash: This feels like a meme
Bash: But it's from a GOOD source
Bash: idk how to feel
Bash: oh wait nah it uses one
Bash: whew
Bash: it determines how quickly data can be transferred between the GPU and the system's memory
Bash: For example, a 256-bit memory bus can deliver twice as much data as the 128-bit at the same speed.
Bash: It's the speed the GPU can access data in vram
Bash: @Bash
Bash: WHO PINGED ME
Bash: but sam the best part
Bash: Is the size
Bash: 304 mm x 137 mm x 61 mm founders edition

Bash: And train it on billions of moneys
Bash: Ok
Bash: i need you to meet miles
Bash: it has to happen
Bash: Ah yes
Bash: 1
Bash: Also I am making a retarded language model rn
Bash: It will have so little training data that it will be brainrotted
Bash: I need to get Linux for this project tho :monkaS:
Bash: THIS IS SO SLOW
Bash: using CPU for the ai
Bash: CPU?
Bash: how good is it...
Bash: well WHICH ONE
Bash: Is it at least 4 core
Bash: Ooooo
Bash: Oh but like
Bash: the $270 ones
Bash: not the $2139 ones
Bash: is it a Surface Pro 5 (2017)
Bash: That honestly could maybe work
Bash: DEBIAN 💀
Bash: Bro does not know anything about linux if he is using debian
Bash: script kiddie aah
Bash: Over debian, anything, my first pick is Ubuntu 24.01, second pick is Mint but Ubuntu is really just better
Bash: And they don't sell info
Bash: they have like 600 employees lmao
Bash: It has a huge community so there is more support
Bash: if it were for an enterprise application...
Bash: openSUSE or Fedora
Bash: https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/1ccjtbz/what_is_the_most_popular_linux_distribution_on_pc/
Bash: almost everyone agrees
Bash: Guess what i did sam teehee
Bash: I made an entire 2Tb SSD a RAM swapfile and im using it to generate a 32K resolution image
Bash: ok so
Bash: actually dont do that because
Bash: apparently there is a windows limitation
Bash: and this causes complete OS corrumption
Bash: I managed to save it with a live Ubuntu USB
Bash: and my Windows install is fine but
Bash: sending this to myself
Bash: https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon/en/latest/index.html
Bash: bro with my coding knowledge I think I could actuall figure out how to make a native text to text language model
Bash: Ok
Bash: Best part about Ubuntu?
Bash: Just plug your phone in and it can just see the files
Bash: No iTunes needed
Bash: I finally got ROCm installed on my GPU

Bash: that would be more expensive than just robbing a bank
Bash: for the money
Bash: ill give you 9 months 😏
Bash: `
Bash: Look at that wonderful yappage
Bash: Since I am using the same low level code and they are all AMD devices I can technically use my CPU, iGPU, and dGPU all at once
Bash: Which means via CPU i can use swap, iGPU can use cache and system RAM, and dGPU can use VRAM
Bash: But my PC will freeze if I use 100% of everything lol
Bash: That would literally be 100% SSD, RAM, CPU, iGPU and dGPU usage
Bash: ultimate benchmark
Bash: What stop
Bash: Start
Bash: Wait i know why
Bash: Because we don't have a start using start signs sign
Bash: Because nobody has made a make a start using start signs sign sign
Bash: Probably because start making a make a start using start signs sign sign sign sign hasn't been invented yet
Bash: PLEASE STOP 💀
Bash: Ok
Bash: Yeah that is how a lot of tests work
Bash: Just get a hundred

Bash: I knew you would like this game because it's minecraft fnaf world hack slash loot
Bash: ROLL MORE
Bash: You dont need them
Bash: Yet
Bash: I think The Tiny Scourge can be found here after you beat the game but that might be highblock halls
Bash: the hurt noises i forgot 💀
Bash: THAT ARTIFACT CAN BLOCK CORRUPTION?
Bash: YIPPEEE
Bash: It is best played multiplayer tbh
Bash: Have you watched the Stronghold cutscene
Bash: WATCH IT
Bash: No sam
Bash: Go to the Stronghold
Bash: Wait
Bash: It didnt play it
Bash: theres no end to the level rn
Bash: it should have shown you the stronghold cutscene
Bash: I suggest starting with the Seeking Truth
Bash: in pumpkin pastures
Bash: its the thing that guards the eye
Bash: And then when you get back to camp I have to show you moo
Bash: Just go down all of the paths on the map and it will bring you to the seeking truth
Bash: it isnt in the same place every time
Bash: Glaive moment
Bash: Did you nose aah skeletons
Bash: Right click weapons to instantly swap them
Bash: HE IS LEARNING

Bash: Good
Bash: About halfway through the level you will get to a wall and you will want to look for these crates
Bash: Wrong picture
Bash: im getting an ice pack for my phone 💀
Bash: This could be it tbh
Bash: feels a bit too big to be a normal room
Bash: You will know you are about to find one of the guardians because you will go down very far
Bash: This has to be the path
Bash: IT IS
Bash: GOOD LUCK
Bash: Be prepared for a fight
Bash: You cant have you just unlocked them

Bash: Just keep an eye out for a wall tjat looks like this
Bash: The levels are slightly different every time you play so it's hard to describe where things are
Bash: Ok
Bash: You at least got the Eye so
Bash: It was probably way closer to the start of the level
Bash: Did you nose you can salvage weapons
Bash: Gaunlets are OP
Bash: BUT always check village merchant first

Bash: BROS EMERALDSMAXXING
Bash: WHY ONCE
Bash: UPGRADE THE ENCHANTS
Bash: i hate the way you play 💀

Bash: How do you have so many emeralds
Bash: Did you pet farm pumpkin pastures bridge
Bash: HIGHER DIFFICULTY
Bash: do +4
Bash: ez
Bash: just dont die
Bash: Ok base
Bash: check out the islands
Bash: or not
Bash: When you reach the end of the level do NOT go through the exit door
Bash: trust
Bash: I am building my AI training data rn
Bash: i have 30 gigabytes of data that should be enough
Bash: ok bro i have work tomorrow imma sleep but before

Bash: What did he say
Bash: indeed
Bash: 💀
Bash: Consult the boys on this one
Bash: What i just said was wild 💀
Bash: Cuz it is funny
Bash: The best course of action would be to say how you are and then tell him what you feel about the situation 
you dont have to mention me if you dont want to
Bash: Im not gonna really say what i would say if i were you because im mad at walt and dont want to let that control my words
Bash: I would appreciate at minimum an explanation preferably an apology

Bash: YIPPEE
Bash: Pin me more sam
Bash: 🤨
Bash: I just figured out time
Bash: Time is not a line
Bash: It is an expanding sphere structured upon lower layers of itself creating new points during expansion, and as a sphere has infinite points each branch of the time structure fills in the point gaps since there are infinite possibilities
Bash: Hi
Bash: 👃🧀➡️🧀🤔🍴🧀🤯🧀
Bash: I just actually read this its so retarded help 💀
Bash: Did you nose, did you nose that if your inhale too much, it will trick your lungs into air breathing? This is because, inhaling tricks your lungs into air thinking.
Bash: Did you know? Did you nose, that if you breath too much air, that your nose will think it is a fish? This is, this is because fish breathes a lot of water, which tricks your fish into human nose thinking.
Bash: You and my FBI agent

Bash: Ok
Bash: You said that exactly as a hydrogen bomb detonated in a video
Bash: Did you know that Betelgeuse has a high chance of supernovaeing soon, causing three days of daytime
Bash: 642.5 🤓
Bash: In astronomy that is like a second
Bash: We need to make advanced tools to detect when the light will hit earth so we can play the outer wilds song
Bash: Ok
Bash: I don't have that much sand
Bash: Yes
Bash: Sandm Bolsand
Bash: Just watch the dune movie in a hologram and then turn it upside down so the sand falls out
Bash: And we must present our findings to the scientific community in the Did you nose? format. Did you nose that if your<insert solution to string theory>

Bash: "But there's a chance I live in Kennesaw, GA, 30144" 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Bash: I am designing a Nose cyberattack against you
Bash: it may take days
Bash: it may take years
Bash: hahahahahaha
Bash: i figured something out
Bash: We should set chatGPT to think we are one person with DID
Bash: YES
Bash: YES I DID IT SAM
Bash: THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY
Bash: Wouldn't you like to know what I am doing :)
Bash: No it noesn't
Bash: It thinks it is two differenr people
Bash: I had to download really sus software that I found deep in a russian forum for this project
Bash: It is a secret
Bash: this
Bash: I am doing that
Bash: I am being especially devious with this one
Bash: Oh also I forgot to mention that I made a python script that will port your current installation of mc dungeons into your steam library so that you will have your own copy and then we can play multiplayer
Bash: it uses the keys i already have and tricks it into thinking I changed my email and then soft launches it which generates new hashes but then it kills it right after and then moves the .exe to steam copying the file structures i saw online
Bash: it worked on my end but i don't have another outlook email to test and i was headed out
Bash: we should play tonight i get home around 9
Bash: Hi
Bash: Did YOU nose?
Bash: 💀
Bash: You home?
Bash: I dropped my phone again 💀
Bash: it has a billion cracks but theyre all in a layer under the glass so you can only see them off center

Bash: SAM STOP EDGING MY PATIENCE HOP ON 💀
Bash: My
Bash: I mean
Bash: The game
Bash: Ok
Bash: Ok
Bash: Make sure the minecraft launcher is logged in with my account and is open in the background
Bash: then open where the script is in finder and double click it you dont need to run as admin jt will mess it up if you do
Bash: also make sure steam is closed before
Bash: STOP 💀
Bash: what time play
Bash: Did you nose? Did you nose, that your computer is now infected with nose? You nose, upon execution, a python script can launch a legitimate process and then replace the code for that process and relaunch? This is granting the script high level administrative permissions. This means, that the code can then inject itself into the Windows registry as a critical system conponent and Windows driver, prompting the system to believe that the script should be invisible to the user, undeletable, and should start automatically when the user logs in? Did you nose, you nose that I will charge 1 nose to provide removal instructions?
Bash: Also the script does nothing except nose virus :)

i am buying myself a new copy of dungeons tho so we can still play 💀

Bash: open documents in terminal and ls or dir
Bash: right click empty space in documents folder click open in terminal
Bash: type dir and hit enter
Bash: look for nosevirus or nose .pyw
Bash: then sudo rm it
Bash: ok try ls

Bash: there are 26 ancients
Bash: In order to find an ancient you must go on an ancient hunt
Bash: Going on ancient hunts requires sacrifing precious materials and enchantment points that you can never get back
Bash: I have only ever managed to defeat one ancient
Bash: i encountered a frostwarden on this playthrough
Bash: I DEFEATED AN ANCIENT LETS GOO
Bash: What is that
Bash: i just work ahead in my classes

Bash: like 6:25 am poole conferences and 5am PT meetings every Tuesday/Thursday
Bash: Poole is my "rank"
Bash: You're a poole before you ship, then a recruit during BT, then a Private Second Class after BT
Bash: The ranks dont have badges until Private First Class which is next after Second Class

Bash: So I respect him
Bash: Hes like a 5gb ddr2 human able to run windows 11
Bash: Just some drivers cant update
Bash: Isaac is cursed
Bash: He 9/10 times will just say hello and hi and "you are my best friend" and then 1/10 times breaks the 4th wall by imagining he has all his chromosomes and is able to actively debate the bible incredibly well and then goes back to being his usual self
Bash: Good guy
Bash: Just bad specs

Bash: It could be too close
Bash: Yeah
Bash: There's lots of processing and preparation and I don't know the process yet
Bash: Yeah
Bash: You can't really work ahead on it but I can get enough information to see if I can go
Bash: My ship date can also change to be sooner or later depending on the logistics
Bash: Im technically not even allowed to do "functions" but my recruiter said he doesn't care as long as I don't break code
Bash: I am required to follow a code of conduct and it states that I may not speak to members outside of the line of duty unless otherwise noted, place myself in a situation in which I may be injured, or be involved with the police.
Bash: That is what is written but obviously they don't enforce it that much on Pooles
Bash: Because I am administratively considered active duty rn
Bash: No my phone is at my house and I am typing telepathically
Bash: Well these rules are normally enforced within a military compound
Bash: So while I am in a government building, vehicle, or military complex, these rules will be enforced on me
Bash: This has to be a top ten comment
Bash: On a video of a tiktokker getting pepper sprayed for doing a violent prank and them crying about it

Bash: Ohhhh ok
Bash: Ohhh i just remembered i have dementia so i forgot
Bash: Oh
Bash: Yeah i guess that has my full social
Bash: I only sent it to you
Bash: Cuz im not supposed to uhh
Bash: Send it
Bash: Lol
Bash: They did
Bash: They wouldn't have any marines 😂
Bash: They didn't bring anything up from our DM they were only interested in my international contacts like with Be Quiet
Bash: I only hear 240 volts
Bash: Nu uh
Bash: ok this time call me when u can play
Bash: i actually deleted the whole sleep schedule thing
Bash: and took phone off silent
Bash: then why are you applying to go to more school
Bash: There is potential for money yes
Bash: But when you take everything into account
Bash: It balences out
Bash: See my way of thinking about it is im not really doing anything for money I just seek happiness first and money is a side benefit but my brain is also not capable of planning for the future yet (lol i dont have a car) and that part of my brain is slowly gaining traction but not fast enough for me to want to invest in college and go 30k in debt to potentially get a 100k job when i could right now get paid 80k a year starting and then invest in stock or real estate with the incredible benefits the military offers
Bash: but again

Bash: Did you nose ? Did you nose that, celery is really strong? Did you nose that, if you compare the strength of celery and a Boeing 737 wing, the Boeing 737 wing will be stronger? This is because, wings are not made of celery.
Bash: Did you nose? Did you nose, that if you jump of a building while wearing a special wooden flight suit, you will still fall to the ground? This is because, this is because you are not a plane.

Bash: Ok
Bash: WAKE UP 💀
Bash: OK
Bash: Look at this song you made
Bash: I did some randall munroeing today
Bash: The capacity of a 9v battery is about 550 mAh. So, we can convert that to Coulombs: 
```
Capacity (Ah) = 550mAh/1000 = 0.55 Ah
```
```
Charge (C) = Capacity (Ah) x 3600s/h = 0.55 Ah x 3600s/h = 1980 C
```
And then use this to calculate the energy in joules:
```
Energy (J) = Voltage (V) x Charge (C) = 9 V x 1980 C = 17,820 J
```

Total energy of `19,584` 9V batteries = `348,986,880 Joules`

= a detonation force equal to `8.34×10 ^−8` megatons (`83.4` kilograms) of TNT upon connection of the jumper cables

A standard 155mm artillery shell contains about 6 to 8 kilograms of TNT

The Mark 81 bomb yields about 113kg of TNT which is the closest you can get I think, with the explosion being perhaps half the size of this one shown here, due to non-perfect efficiency:

Bash: I accidentally did the thing where you flinch super hard as you fall asleep because it feels like you're falling
Bash: Or ill be falling asleep and I know i am going straight to deep because when I close my eyes I can just tell
Bash: its the way your thoughts shift left and right like waves you can literally feel it
Bash: i might have autism
Bash: You would die
Bash: Cuz youd hit the ground too hard
Bash: Are you free too knight
Bash: Or do you habe school objectives
Bash: I *just* now realized how light works
Bash: Light speed is space-time speed
Bash: If the sun disappeared we wouldn't see it for 8 minutes but also the gravitational effects would continue for 8 minutes
Bash: The speed of light is the speed at which space can update
Bash: So this means that gravity must be in a quantum state of particle/wavelength similar to photons
Bash: No, besides it would require a purely incompressible material and an infinite force to move it
Bash: And also it wouldn't be traveling at the speed of light either
Bash: It would be traveling as fast as you push it
Bash: And it would take a LY for you to see the other end move
Bash: Yes
Bash: Hi fucked
Bash: You can probably fix them

Bash: WAKE UP 💀
Bash: Im literally so bored
Bash: i need either you or miles to wake up
Bash: because it is your job to entertain me
Bash: duh
Bash: I am actually developing a full theory
Bash: No
Bash: Read mine
Bash: and ill read yours
Bash: If the sun were to suddenly vanish, Earth would orbit empty space for 8 minutes and 20 seconds.
Bash: Essentially what I am saying is
Bash: Reality is a video game
Bash: and the universe has selective rendering to save on bandwidth
Bash: But also, let's say we take the age of the universe, from beginning to end.
Bash: Each coordinate has a set stack of PMBs
Bash: When they all are exhausted that point is dead
Bash: Meaning the universe will eventually end
Bash: Or reality will eventually end
Bash: Informational entropy
Bash: The universe has a finite informational capacity
Bash: bro had to do it
Bash: he had to convert reality.universe into reality.mp3
Bash: It is technically possible based on my theory
Bash: A PMB could be encoded to be human-readable
Bash: But it would take up infinite storage
Bash: Ok
Bash: True
Bash: I cant believe I actually bought a discord avatar decoration 😭
Bash: It got me
Bash: i need to turn this into a formula
Bash: and present it to reddit
Bash: i need to define the spatial extent of a point where a stack of PMBs exists
Bash: Look at the conversation
Bash: its getting oppenheimer level redonkulous
Bash: we should hang out today
Bash: if you can
Bash: Hidk
Bash: 4s 259ms delay, which is odd since you're on PC
Bash: Sam
Bash: I just figured out that I can measure the age of reality
Bash: But it doesn't matter because we don't know when it started
Bash: The total time it takes for all PMBs in a stack to be consumed is the maximum age of the coordinate, so you can derive the maximum age from the rate of consumption of a PMB
Bash: I think i need to rename them
Bash: PMB is dumb
Bash: planck metabit is dumb
Bash: How about noeton, from 'noesis' (Greek for 'understanding'), suggesting a basic unit of cognition or metainformation.
Bash: Ok
Bash: SHUT UP 💀
Bash: NOOOSE
Bash: i cant wait to make a reddit post titled "I discovered the age of reality ong no cap fr fr"
Bash: I did the math, reality will end in 20250000000000000000000000000000000000000000 years 💀
Bash: Something is off about that 💀
Bash: Ok
Bash: bro einstein must be rolling in his grave rn
Bash: cuz he spent to much time discovering relativity just for us to goof like this
Bash: he nosed
Bash: He smelled reality, which tricked his nose into reality thinking.
Bash: Wait I may be able to refine it
Bash: A coordinate with the age of 1 total second would have a total noeton stack of 1.855x10^43
Bash: On average, base on how each point can update at any time, noetons are consumed uniformly across the universe
Bash: https://1drv.ms/w/c/1f81e29b858f6cba/EUbF-meusQNEj9EYDvrQePoBOcW452gZ1jkwYSuU8mVXBg?e=UIWySH
Bash: The observable universe is about 28.5 gigaparsecs in diameter
Bash: So if we set the Tmax of reality to 2024 years, then the total noeton count is 1.0022×10^239
Bash: Noes
Bash: there arent
Bash: 1.184x10^54 N per planck volume, or coordinate
Bash: Did you nose? that any answer I say is right because its all a theory
Bash: There are 500 suns in our solar system according to my theory
Bash: Because a future neoton state could be this
Bash: Or stacked neoton state
Bash: As they become destacked they cease to exist
Bash: There can only be one noeton per coordinate at one time
Bash: imagine a can of pringles
Bash: You cut a tiny slat in the bottom of the can, so you can only take one pringle out at one time
Bash: The pringle can is the coordinate (set by a planck volume) and the pringle is the amount of information within the space, or a noeton
Bash: You cannot perceieve what the next pringle will be
Bash: But all of them are already there
Bash: And will eventually be exhausted
Bash: And you eat them so they die
Bash: You eat them at the speed of light 💀
Bash: And there are 1,184,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pringles per can
Bash: And there are 8.458x10^184 cans
Bash: Ok
Bash: The number of coordinates increases at an exponential rate but they update with the same amount of noetons as the previous coordinate
Bash: And then continue to age at the set rate
Bash: Are you home
Bash: Wanna dungeon
Bash: bro its so close that it doesnt matter
Bash: erm sigma
Bash: nose i waited
Bash: Pinned a message.
Bash: ok get on game now

Bash: ok
Bash: I managed to log in to the XFINITY web console and add an additional device that matches all of the identifiers of the security cameras in out house, but the IP address is my PCs. Then I spoofed my PCs second ethernet port MAC address to match one of the cameras in our house. So now if the camera is unpaused, my PCs WiFi will be unpaused if I switch to the other port. But I kept my WiFi MAC the default so it shows up as TobysPC on the WiFi and can still be paused and unpaused, but my ethernet shows up as RingStickupCam-B5 (following the naming scheme of the other three cameras)
Bash: Its foolproof
Bash: They will never know and the cameras are always online
Bash: But I can still make it look to them like they can pause it by switching to wifi
Bash: The only reason the web console had default password is because we got new router
Bash: and i have a keyboard shortcut set up to toggle the internet adapters to pausable mode pr always on mode

Bash: Wanna play Minecraft Dungeons
Bash: BRO
Bash: I showed Claude this picture
Bash: And it responds with this
Bash: This looks like a typical suburban neighborhood in the southeastern United States. Several clues suggest this:

1. The architectural style - brick and vinyl-sided homes with two-story colonial designs
2. The wide concrete driveways and spacious lots
3. The deciduous trees that appear to be partially in fall colors
4. The yellow-painted home with the gray roof is a common style in southern suburbs
5. The landscape is relatively flat
6. The grass is still fairly green despite what appears to be fall weather
7. The general layout and spacing of the homes is very characteristic of newer (likely 1990s-2000s) southern suburban developments

This could be in states like Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, or Tennessee, where such suburban developments are very common. The combination of the architecture, vegetation, and neighborhood layout is particularly characteristic of Atlanta's suburbs or similar metropolitan areas in the Southeast.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Bash: and it leads to the Stronghold Vault
Bash: which is a sub dungeon
Bash: I am researching strategies
Bash: for maximum advancement
Bash: Auto crossbow with acceleration 3x
Bash: basically a solid line of arrows
Bash: Ok so what I am thinking is the best possible weapon is a cutlass because the combo finishes every other swipe but it is still fast so if you have radiance, thundering, and swirling then it is OP, then armor needs lightning focus, artifact cooldown, and beast burst. Then for bow it doesn't really matter but the imploding crossbow with void strike, multishot, and burst bowstring is OP, then for artifacts you need the enchanters tome, a golem, and a mushroom
Bash: Also I want a flail
Bash: a unique mace variant
Bash: I have waited for 1 femtosecond
Bash: I will now discontinue waitage
Bash: Inconsistent though
Bash: we can compare them
Bash: the cutlass has higher DPS
Bash: can u hop on rn
Bash: Perfect
Bash: literally the perfect time
Bash: The best part about the game is there isn't enough time in the world to calculate the best combo because there's too many variations
Bash: Rapier might be faster combo

Bash: The Velociraptor's Jazz Cucumber and the Infinite Sandwich War

In the year 17:42 PM (a perfectly reasonable time-year hybrid), a velociraptor named Gerald woke up to find his left shoe singing opera. This wouldn’t have been odd, except Gerald didn’t own shoes.

"Not again," Gerald muttered in Swahili, which he had never learned but spoke fluently whenever the Moon was upside down. He grabbed his saxophone, which doubled as a cucumber during tax season, and headed to the nearest sandwich dimension—a place where all bread was illegal, but mayonnaise flowed like rivers of molten gold.

Meanwhile, the Infinite Sandwich War raged on. The factions—Team Mustard and Team Pickle—were locked in eternal combat. Nobody remembered why the war started, but rumors whispered it had something to do with a rogue toaster inventing time travel. Gerald, however, didn’t care about war; he was on a quest to find the mythical third slice of bread, said to grant its holder the power to end all sandwiches.

Along the way, Gerald encountered a sentient umbrella who spoke exclusively in riddles about algebra. "What is the square root of an eggplant's dreams?" it asked. Gerald responded by juggling three invisible pineapples, which was apparently the correct answer, as the umbrella exploded into confetti.

At last, Gerald reached the Temple of Crumbs, guarded by a six-headed jellyfish wearing a bowtie made of regret. The jellyfish demanded a password, but Gerald simply held up his jazz cucumber, which emitted a soulful tune that caused the jellyfish to dissolve into a puddle of existential crisis.
Inside the temple, Gerald found the third slice of bread—but it was alive and very angry. "I AM THE BREAD OF CHAOS," it boomed, and began reciting limericks about quantum physics while breakdancing. Gerald tried to calm it down by offering a peanut butter truce, but the bread declared, “PEANUTS ARE A LIE!” before teleporting itself into a dimension where time ran backward and squirrels ruled the world.
Utterly confused and now craving pancakes, Gerald abandoned his quest and opened a jazz club for disgruntled kitchen utensils. His first customer was a spoon named Maurice, who had a dark past but loved tap-dancing.
And thus, the Infinite Sandwich War continued, unresolved, forever leaving historians scratching their heads and wondering why cucumbers could even play jazz.

Bash: i have a theory
Bash: the 9950X3D will be better in gaming than the 9800X3D
Bash: this is because
Bash: the 9800X3D is out of stock everywhere
Bash: and AMD is not making many
Bash: which means they are using those machines to make 9950X3Ds
Bash: and focus on more stock of that
Bash: then why aren't they manufacturing bootyloads
Bash: they would all sell
Bash: no they aren't
Bash: You cannot find a single 9800X3D in stock at any of 19 online retailers
Bash: for msrp
Bash: only available on Amazon for 700 dollars
Bash: 7950X3D was worse than 7800X3D
Bash: because
Bash: split 3d vcache over multiple dies

Bash: RUSSIN COMPOSERS ARE GOATED!! because their fathers beat them with a half broken vodka bottle til they could outdo Bethoven, and then through time, and therapy, and more time, and other more different therapy, and then finding a wife, they healed, and decided to play piano again. since their neural pathways were pushed so far when they were young, piano is more familiar to them than the russian language itself. In fact, because of the age they are started at, and the violent manner in which they are forced to learn, their brains surpass what most human beings are capable of achieving in their life. This is because rather than the growth of those neural pathways being fueled by curiosity, they are fueled by the much stronger force of their drunken fathers. This is also why such composers do not exist in the modern era, as said fathers are much too busy bullying american children online, who unlike their russian counterparts, are much harder to break, as they are not usually broken from a young age, though some households do engage in this.

Added image '\Users\Russell\Downloads\10-15-Day.jpg'
The image depicts a serene and majestic landscape of an island or peninsula, surrounded by the vast expanse of the ocean. The scene
is characterized by its natural beauty, with elements that evoke a sense of tranquility and wonder.

**Key Elements:**

* **Island/Peninsula:** The central focus of the image is a landmass that juts out into the sea. Its rugged terrain suggests a
geological history shaped by erosion and weathering processes.
* **Ocean:** The surrounding waters are calm, reflecting the colors of the sky above. This tranquility could indicate either a
protected cove or a moment of stillness before the onset of more turbulent weather conditions.
* **Sky:** Above, the sky transitions from lighter hues near the horizon to deeper shades towards the top of the frame. This
gradient implies that the photograph was taken during either dawn or dusk when light scatters through the atmosphere in such a way
as to produce these vibrant colors.

**Atmosphere and Mood:**

The overall atmosphere of the image is one of peacefulness and awe. The combination of natural forms - land, sea, and sky - creates
a visually striking composition that invites contemplation. The soft lighting enhances this effect, making the scene feel almost
ethereal or otherworldly.

**Technical Aspects:**

* **Composition:** The photographer has skillfully composed the shot to draw attention to the island/penninsula while also capturing
the vastness of the ocean and the dynamic sky.
* **Lighting:** The use of natural light adds depth and texture to the image, highlighting the contours of the land and the movement
of the water.
* **Color Palette:** The muted tones of greens and browns in the foreground contrast beautifully with the blues and pinks of the
background, creating a harmonious visual balance.

In summary, this image presents a breathtaking view of an island or peninsula set against the backdrop of a serene ocean under a
dramatic sky. Its composition, lighting, and color palette all contribute to evoking feelings of serenity and wonder in the viewer.

Bash: Impossible to get anywhere except this dm
Bash: Ugly ass plane
Bash: Okay very important note before you choose to accept Delivery side quest
Bash: I was supposed to get paid yesterday but since I am training either the majority west cost marines my payday will start again a few days 1st of July
Bash: So you would not receive money same day
Bash: My schedule looks like this:
Today: EOD ~10:00
Tuesday-Wednesday: 05:45 PT, 09:00 PT, 13:00 ACC F
Thursday-Monday federal holiday liberty
Bash: It's best for you to come during con 2 so Thursday through Monday
Bash: Or actually
Bash: I can meet you off base
Bash: That would be optimal
Bash: Or you can meet my driver off base
Bash: Typer
Bash: -1 days ago
Bash: The best time and date to arrive is at 13:30 CST, Thursday, June 19th 2025. You will arrive at East Gate, I will be there to sponsor your visitation on base. We will lie and say you are here for the Museum, then we will just drive to 709 East Avenue. We should also check out the museum as an alibi because it's the largest rarest aviation museum in the united states i believe
Bash: Worse case scenario they dont let you in at the gate and I have to call my driver to transport my things from off base to my barracks
Bash: But i do want to show you around
Bash: There is a chance you will also be shot on sight
Bash: But
Bash: Probably minimal
Bash: Because
Bash: Everyone will be in civilian gear
Bash: I will teach you who to say the proper greeting of the day to and you will not be challenged
Bash: You look like a Seaman anyways:brownskull:
Bash: Theres so much seaman on base
Bash: Its all over
Bash: I really want my stuff **NOW**.
Bash: buts
Bash: This is not practical for all parties involved
Bash: So
Bash: https://maps.apple.com/place?coordinate=30.376161,-87.275765&name=Marked%20Location&map=explore
Bash: This is the location you are to drive to
Bash: At that point it will be assessed how to move from there
Bash: Since I am technically sneaking you into the highest security base in Florida
Bash: :slugnod:
Bash: Shall be fun
Bash: Okay so make sure to take a left turn not a right turn after the gate
Bash: Or you could get shot
Bash: Left from me or you?
Bash: Wait
Bash: Okay just pick one and we will hope
Bash: So
Bash: The Navy Lodge is expensives
Bash: And they WILL find you here in the barracks even though I have a third bed
Bash: So
Bash: I personally would like to not pay for your lodging
Bash: Okay
Bash: Change of plans
Bash: Earlier
Bash: You will arrive here at 16:30 CST, Wednesday, June 18th
Bash: It distorted the image with its power
Bash: Because condition 2 starts at 16:00
Bash: Leaving me 30 minutes to get to east gate
Bash: R98

Bash: O b v i o u s l y

13:00 instead of 14:00
Bash: To allow my backup plan driver to have time to get to another appointment
Bash: Bevause this is a sensitive operation
Bash: I have a backup in case you cant get on base
Bash: Or alternatively
Bash: 16:30-17:00 arrival time
Bash: Either of those two would work
Bash: Okays this is complicated
Bash: Just come at regular time and I will meet you at the gate
Bash: Then I will watch the packages at the gate and get my driver to meet me
Bash: So 14:00 as previously stated
Bash: Just pretend every message after here doesn't exist

Bash: Wee snaw
Bash: Hop on GTA while Michael is out so he cant play top 10 ragebait :trollface:
Bash: did you nose? Did you nose thats if my GPU fans were actually spinning at, 67 million rpm they would draw 60 quadrillion watts and heat my GPU up to ~1,000,000 degrees Celsius
Bash: play video games with me
Bash: college is for nerds
Bash: edge in class
Bash: All those who believe in schizophrenia raise my imaginary hands
Bash: 💀 aah reaction
Bash: Wee snaw
Bash: - The fans would spin at 1.13 MHz
- The tip speed would be 0.13% the speed of light
- It would take 0.887 nanoseconds per revolution 
- The blade pass frequency would be in shortwave radio territory (10.148064 MHz)
- Stored rotational energy equivalent to 1.8 tons of TNT
- The order-of-magnitude hoop stress would be ~180,000 gigapascals
- Shock/stagnation temperature rise of 75 million kelvin
- Dynamic pressure at blade tip = 890,000 atmospheres
- Produces 14.6 terawatts of xray radiation enough to be lethal in 3 nanoseconds
Bash: Where do you think the thermal ablation comes from bruh
Bash: Obviously factored in air resistance
Bash: There wouldn't be enough time for the air to be resistance
Bash: Thermal bremsstrahlung (free–free): electrons braking in ion fields = a smooth continuum that roughly peaks around hν∼kT
Bash: It splits the air
Bash: So no resistance
Bash: Is actually splits and recombines the gasses
Bash: Instantly ionizes argon oxygen and nitrogen
Bash: Bro thinks it actually spins at .13 C
Bash: You would need a 839 meter thick wall of lead to protect you
Bash: For 1 second 💀

Cross referencing >50 different HTML/CSS/JS scripts and picking out single sections and making changes with high accuracy? :chessgreatmove:

Terminal throws an error? It reads error and takes corrective action.

Accepts image uploads? :Blue_Yippie:

Deep integration with VSCode :rivflabbergasted:

Bash: I needed that.
Bash: I would greatly appreciate that!
Bash: This helper needs help
Bash: He is :slugwornout:
Bash: he wants to go home he has only been home 6 days since december
Bash: I willingly chose this life
Bash: I am okay. Thank you
Bash: How are you?
Bash: I like being your friend
Bash: You don't have to respond in any particular way
Bash: I just like people to know when I enjoy being around them
Bash: I can't explain anything in depth of course, but my
MOS (military occupational specialty) is MOS 6116. I am a technician on the MV-22 Osprey, a vertical takeoff tiltrotor aircraft. 

I take care of preventative mechanical and electrical maintenance of everything from engines to control systems. I am also trained in more emergency maintenance but I don't have to do it regularly. I am heavily trained for scenarios such as crashing behind enemy lines or over the ocean. I also have secondary and tertiary contracts, such as Military Police (MP) and signals intelligence (SIGINT). These jobs I do when there are not enough qualified Marines to do them at the time or place they are needed.
Bash: If you ask questions I will answer with what I am allowed to say
Bash: Nono that's okay it's a good question
Bash: I do get deployed to the field, I have spent time in Yemen and Syria

When a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) is deployed to a location, it consists of a Command element, a Ground Combat element, an Aviation Combat element (this is where I am), and a Logistics Combat element.

I am part of what is called a Reinforced Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron, which has MV-22 Ospreys, AH-1Z Cobras, and other UAVs.
Bash: We go to the same active combat zones that the infantry is sent to
Bash: Occasionally, airmen help units on the ground as well. All Marines are trained as riflemen and can carry out the basic job of an infantry unit. We all go through a month-long course called MCT where we learn how to integrate with the infantry during combat.
Bash: :D
Bash: What do you plan to do?
Bash: The Marines are actually quite a small fighting force. We have 175,000 Marines versus the U.S. Army, which has 2,000,000 soldiers. So I suppose it's fairly rare to meet one.
Bash: Biotechnology :CaramelLizPlead:
Bash: The military is a very hard life. In my position I have to make sure this bird stays in the air or else I could kill 30 Marines. If I accidentally leave my screwdriver on an engine shelf then I could again, kill 30 Marines. I have real lives in my hands 24/7. I am also a senior LCpl. with a squad of 13-16 Marines under my direct command. I don't eat or sleep until they are all taken care of.
Bash: But at the end of the day, I am living a life that rejects passivity, accepts responsibility, and leads courageously in a way that brings honor to my family and serves my country. I never regret a single day no matter how gruesome it may be. I am proud of what I do.
Bash: And I completely respect you saying that
Bash: I know our leaders don't make the best decisions
Bash: But it's my home and my friends and family live here so I will die for it
Bash: Infact Trump has made me pretty mad recently, doing a bunch of crazy shit
Bash: He doesn't make this country too safe for my friends tbh
Bash: He is actually an incredibly smart man who has enacted some genius policies. **But**. He has also done some very detrimental things without thinking about the consequences.
Bash: A lot of people take what he says and does out of context due to heavy media bias towards the left, but some of what he does is actually insane
Bash: He forgets we are people haha
Bash: No need to reserve anything. I am apolitical anyways.
Bash: (Not because I want to avoid being political, but because of orders. I still vote for who I want but I am not supposed to talk about it publicly)
Bash: May I ask, what country are you from?
Bash: That's alright
Bash: I think this is a good way to put it.
Bash: I don't especially enjoy conversations about politics.
Bash: What plans do you have for the day :monkconfused:
Bash: Ask away.
Bash: The 25¢ coin? No not at all
Bash: It's always made sense to me
Bash: I never knew that
Bash: This is true.
Bash: I just hope he doesn't make some new coin with his orange face on it.
Bash: XD
Bash: He would.
Bash: I like this idea.
Bash: I haven't used physical change in probably a year.
Bash: I rarely pay in cash.
Bash: I enjoy these types of conversations. Don't worry about yapping.
Bash: And the nickle.
Bash: You spelled it right when the American didn't 💀
Bash: Lmao
Bash: Yeah.
Bash: And Lincoln won't be as remembered
Bash: He is on the penny
Bash: I like the word nix.
Bash: Heheh
Bash: You talk in a professional manner
Bash: I didn't know that.
Bash: Hey.
Bash: Don't apologize goofball
Bash: How have you been.
Bash: I'm physically well.... mentally not. I was woken up by nightmares. Haven't been able to fall asleep again since 0100
Bash: Heh. It's okay
Bash: I just came here to catch up with a friend. Don't worry about me.
Bash: Hmmm...
Bash: Do you know of any good ways to sleep dreamlessly
Bash: I did just take some melatonin to help
Bash: If i disappear, don't worry, it's just the melatonin knocking me out haha
Bash: I did end up getting more sleep.
Bash: Thanks for the chat earlier.
Bash: I appreciate your friendship
Bash: :boop:
Bash: hello.
Bash: actually kinda hurt at the moment
Bash: but it's nothing important
Bash: are you well?
Bash: Just a weird software bug
Bash: I use Vencord, and the relationship notifier plugin. it said "you are no longer friends with:" and then just kept popping up saying people were unfriending me until they were all unfriended and people were not responding to me so i really thought it was the end
Bash: Well
Don't start using it today :monksweat:
Bash: :BarbecueComfortHug:
Bash: Nope. I do have a nice long break this weekend, 96 hour liberty.
Bash: hey. Are you doing well?
Bash: I'm doing okay.
Bash: Holding up.
Bash: :nightsalute:
Bash: Ha. That's the thing. I don't have the time to tale time to myself.
Bash: Me too.
Bash: :1r_huggyhug:
Bash: You're never a bother
Bash: I just didn't have the time to respond so I apologize.
Bash: Hey :BarbecueComfortHug: Nice to run into you tonight.
Bash: I'm feeling really upset, so I would appreciate company if you would like to maybe, talk about your day? Or something you like.
Bash: Hmm. I think I do
Bash: 1.20.1 was the last version I have played
Bash: Instamineable is a fascinating word
Bash: I love making words like that!
Bash: Thank you.
Bash: May I ask you a question? I am sorry to interrupt.
Bash: What name would you prefer to be called?
Bash: Thank you Celestium, for talking to me. It means a lot more to me than you might think.
Bash: What did I do that's worthy of thanks?
Bash: Oh. :SM_giggle:
Bash: :BarbecueComfortHug:
Bash: You seem to enjoy Minecraft
Bash: I've been trying to remember which versions of Bliss, Iris, Fabric, Distant Horizons and Minecraft are compatible with each other.
Bash: Last time I tried using them on my RTX 3060, I was able to create these images with a render distance of 8,192:
Bash: Now that I have an RTX 5090, I want to try to create some more screenshots. But I can't find the files that are compatible with each other :(
Bash: I believe it was Minecraft 1.20.1
Bash: Yes!
Bash: Woah!!
Bash: can you please upload a .zip of the mods folder you used here :CaramelLizPlead:
Bash: Thank you!!
Bash: Okay thank you :)
Bash: :SM_giggle:
Bash: It's okay
Bash: I appreciate the help.
Bash: :saintwave:
Bash: I am not on my PC at the moment. I'm too..,,, wraught. Is a good word.
Bash: If I am being honest? I don't know.
Bash: Maybe I should try to sleep.
Bash: Thank you :BarbecueComfortHug:
Bash: You as well
Bash: helloo
Bash: :spearrivhug:
Bash: How are you Celestium my beautiful friend
Bash: I'm so glad I met you :BarbecueComfortHug:
Bash: I'm doing very well
Bash: I'm on guard duty tonight so I have had lots of time to write a bunch of thoughts down.
Bash: I almost finished writing 8 pages
Bash: I got carried away.
Bash: Celestium!
Bash: Some Minecraft screenshots.
Bash: Oh hello!
Bash: I apologize for not responding I read your messages and... i just. Forgot. :(
Bash: :spearrivhug:
Bash: I've played through both the base game and DLC, it's definitely in my top 3 favorite games
Bash: :slughug:
Bash: :1r_lovinghugfromback:
Bash: Hey!
Bash: I'm quite well :hunterukelele:
Bash: What about you?
Bash: might you be awake?
Bash: I'm glad.
Bash: Are you well?
Bash: Can I please see it?
Bash: OUTER WILDS
Bash: :rivstareclose:
Bash: You are a VERY skilled artist.
Bash: This is making me tear up im not even lying
Bash: That's how beautiful it is
Bash: I have a really strong affection towards Outer Wilds
Bash: When I beat the game, it was like having to say goodbye to an old friend...
Bash: And the shading is beautiful in this art piece
Bash: The light is perfect
Bash: It really captures the feeling the game gives me
Bash: Is this something I could buy?
Bash: :CyanLizPet: well if you don't have anyone else in line I would love something similar but perhaps with a Nomai.
Bash: The cost doesn't matter
Bash: I have to have this. It's beautiful
Bash: You could name your price. I don't care about what you normally charge.
Bash: What's this feeling called, there is a word for it...
Bash: Wanderlust
Bash: That's what it makes me feel.
Bash: The urge to see the unseen
Bash: I don't know if it's a real word.
Bash: Yes.
Bash: Please do, don't feel any pressure but- 
How else do I say this
Bash: you can't add time to life
Bash: and things like this, art like this
Bash: it makes life timeless
Bash: Don't worry. No pressure.
Bash: In fact I am low on money right now too, and I want to pay you a LOT for this. I just spent all my spending money to secretly upgrade my friend's PC behind her back. Really an evil plan.
Bash: Me too.
Bash: I wish I could do it for everyone.
Bash: Good night.
Bash: :rivstareclose:
Bash: hey.
Bash: are you doing alright?
Bash: Hello!
Bash: didn't sleep.
Bash: I'm sick i think
Bash: going to attempt to get a quarantine order so i can recover
Bash: Yeah.
Bash: I'm trying
Bash: That's okay.
Bash: :BarbecueComfortHug:
Bash: Alright.
Bash: No need to make any promises :hunterpet2:
Bash: :CyanLizPet:
Bash: yeah
Bash: I'm sorry if I worried you
Bash: i lost my job :monknervous:
Bash: I have to do biweekly psychological evaluations in order to maintain my flight status and I failed the most recent one because of DID. I'm finding out soon if I am going to be allowed to work somewhere else in the military, or if they're just going to medically separate me.
Bash: Thanks for the kind words
Bash: :garhug:
Bash: You're a true friend
Bash: I'm not sure what to talk about if I'm being honest
Bash: Sure.
Bash: :garhug:
Bash: Yeah.
Bash: Good
Bash: Ough you're making me hungry
Bash: I should. I may go to the mess hall to get food. I don't get paid until Thursday or else I'd get Panda Express
Bash: Heheh
Bash: :garhug:
Bash: thank you for always being here for me when I need it most
Bash: Good morning
Bash: Are you well?
Bash: Yay!
Bash: Have fun!!
Bash: hey Celestium!
Bash: :garhug:
Bash: are you well?
Bash: pretty sick atm, but mentally I am okay :3
Bash: haiiii
Bash: YES
Bash: would you like it?
Bash: Of course :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: Hello!
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: I was fired actually
Bash: I was fired from the helper team for DMing someone hug emojis, thus making them uncomfortable, even though they had communicated to me previously that they were comfortable with it.

That's why I don't trust RW server staff anymore :huntershruggy:
Bash: Nope. I asked them too. Never got a real answer
Bash: Oh and also because Freya lied about me to staff saying I was being suicidal in DMs and they didn't even ask for proof :slugsad:
Bash: They just believed her i guess
Bash: Yeah
Bash: She hates me because I am in the military
Bash: Said I make her sick because I "promote violence"
Bash: I don't care.
Bash: I have to walk back to the barracks from STUCON i will be back in about 20 minutes
Bash: the only violence i've done was without doubt neccesary to keep people i love at home safe and other people safe
Bash: Well, I'm not exactly a good person. I have a lot of pride and I really like attention.
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: thank you
Bash: did you see my banner?
Bash: Hehehe
Bash: Today is a good day!
Bash: I'm doing well.
Bash: How are you?
Bash: I just started playing.
Bash: I love the graphics but I'm suspecting it's not my type of game
Bash: shhhh go to bed
Bash: we can talk in the morning :3
Bash: Love you! /p
Bash: :CyanLizPet:
Bash: sleep well.
Bash: hey
Bash: are you well?
Bash: I think so
Bash: Yes
Bash: as I am aromantic
Bash: I'm hopping on with some old high school friends
Bash: I appreciate it
Bash: What do you want to know?
Bash: I'm fine with answering questions.
Bash: I couldn't get that from them
Bash: So idk
Bash: They're very closed off with what they share
Bash: No thank you, I don't trust them
Bash: I appreciate you asking
Bash: It's not like they care. They banned Teto too
Bash: He didn't deserve it at all. He said something that they interpreted incorrectly and they banned him for it. This is what he said, and they labeled it as transphobic.
Bash: Even though it's poorly worded, it's actually a pro-trans statement and Teto has never been transphobic over the 40,000 messages he has in the server.
Bash: In fact I on my own time reached out to some of my non-RW trans friends and they agreed with me
Bash: What's going on is there are just popular people in staff that just use their position to get rid of people they don't like.
Bash: It's all very shady and selfish and biased
Bash: That's why I don't interact in RW very much.
Bash: But don't take my word for it, please
Bash: Feel free to do your own research
Bash: Phin, mainly
Bash: Might as well be.
Bash: If I'm being blunt she uh
Bash: She pretty much fucks with all of them so
Bash: In fact she really hurt her partner (monogamous relationship) when he repeatedly asked her to stop and she just basically told him she doesn't care
Bash: She also cut off my 7-8 month friendship because I am "tiring and uninteresting" and "narcissistic and sadistic" which I would get screenshots of rn if it wouldn't hurt to open the DMs again
Bash: I'm trying to be as gentle as I can answering your questions but it's a touchy subject for me
Bash: This community has led me to some really close friends.... and some really fake friends
Bash: It's okay.
Bash: But like I said, please don't just believe what I am saying. That's what's wrong with staff is they don't fact check anything. So fact check me.
Bash: They just operate based on emotions and feelings
Bash: :huntershruggy:
Bash: You might be luckier off that way Celestium
Bash: That's what I thought too
Bash: I got helper because slow-mode annoyed me
Bash: I wont tell them I dont even talk to them
Bash: Lol
Bash: They don't respect me
Bash: A grown man who has been to war can't get some respect
Bash: Hahah
Bash: The only platformer to really grab my attention was Hollow Knight.
Greenpath was so beautiful to me when I first saw it that I cried.
Bash: I like story-driven, atmospheric games with good visuals and music. Some click and some don't.
Bash: I love Outer Wilds.
Bash: 💚
Bash: Beating the game felt like having to say goodbye to an old friend.
Bash: :slugsad:
Bash: I love that description.
Bash: WANDERLUST
Bash: who taught you that word
Bash: OH!
Bash: I was thinking how does Celestium even know that...
Bash: :slughug:
Bash: Vsauce was the first youtuber I ever watched.
Bash: Specifically his video about the collision between Andromeda and the Milky Way
Bash: I like you.
Bash: i love that my life has purpose
Bash: it cost a lot to understand it though
Bash: Pinned a message.
Bash: You're making me cry. I don't know exactly why but I'm crying. It's not a bad thing.
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: Yes! I just got into Act II
Bash: Do I perchance know this friend?
Bash: The only person I've met so far who likes it is Tulin. She convinced me to play.
Bash: I don't know them :3
Bash: That would be fine with me. I don't know if I will respond very much, I'm feeling very emotional
Bash: I haven't seen it.
Bash: I see.
Bash: I'm falling asleep. Not because of you, but because I took some melatonin.
Bash: Good night. Thanks for being my friend, and treating me well
Bash: I slept quite well
Bash: I appreciate the worry, though
Bash: Hey. Would you happen to be up?
Bash: I fell asleep pretty immediately after this
Bash: Yeah. Weird sleep schedule though, 5pm to 1am
Bash: I'm doing pretty well.
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: how about you?
Bash: Thank you.
Bash: it's my love language. That, and gifts.
Bash: I use physical affection online a lot. Because I don't get any in real life.
Bash: I don't think I've had more than a single hug in a year
Bash: I see
Bash: Oh, yeah. Of course
Bash: Celestium!
Bash: Thank you for asking.
Bash: I've been thinking a lot about space.
Bash: One of the most beautiful things.
Bash: Makes you think.
Bash: For example. Why do light and gravity share a single constant?
Bash: The answer is: because C isn't the speed of light.

It's the invariant speed built into spacetime itself.
Bash: Any ripple or particle with no mass must ride the "null" paths of spacetime. And those paths move exactly at C.
Bash: But *why*? *Why* is **c** the exact number?
Bash: I've been researching this a lot. I've come across very interesting things, like phantom dark energy, the Dipole Repeller. There's so much left to understand.
Bash: Einstein barely scratched the surface
Bash: I hunger to
Bash: So I have been. And I came up with this
Bash: We're perhaps thinking about it in the wrong context
Bash: What if light and gravity aren't real at all-

What if they're the perceived propagation of physical information updating across time.

And every point in space had a fixed amount of information that can be held, consumed at a fixed rate...

After which it becomes decayed.

This would explain the Dipole Repeller's *negative* gravitational pull.
Bash: It's difficult to explain classically as it falls outside classical thinking
Bash: So I dug into this
Bash: It already aligns with many things. For example, the Bekenstein bound, Mandelstam–Tamm and Margolus–Levitin bounds
Bash: Only so much entorpy can exist in a space.
Bash: Sorry I am very deep into this. I will come back with a vanilla explanation
Bash: Black-hole thermodynamics gives an upper bound (the Bekenstein bound) on how much information (entropy) fits in a region with given energy and size.

in quantum gravity this morphs into the holographic principle (info scales like area, not volume)
Bash: What I am saying is this: 

the Dipole Repeller’s “dead space” looks like a giant information desert.

If bits per area are bounded (Bekenstein) and spacetime updates at one invariant rate c, then gradients in information density steer geodesics: high-info regions act like attractors, low-info regions like repellers.

In a deep void there’s almost nothing to update; curvature relaxes, local clocks open up, and the boundary sends metric/field updates racing in at c. 

We observe that as matter drifting outward—“negative pull.”

So c is the speed of reconciliation, and both light and gravity are just the same information update propagating across the ledger. 

The Dipole Repeller is a big hole in that ledger.
Bash: I'm sorry if this is too nerdy.
Bash: Think of the universe like a gigantic grid of “pixels” that all update their state. There’s a hard cap on how fast an update can hop from pixel to pixel. That cap is c.
Bash: Light and gravity are both just updates moving across that grid: light is an electromagnetic update, gravity is a “curvature” (geometry) update. Since both are signals on the same grid, they share the same speed limit c
Bash: There’s also a cap on how much information can fit in a region (loosely related to its energy and size). Black holes cram in the maximum; empty space stores very little. That is the bekenstein limit i was referring to.
Bash: Since a space only holds so much information it can run out
Bash: It becomes decayed
Bash: And at that point information flows around it
Bash: It looks like negative gravity, but it’s really deficit-driven drift
Bash: If that makes any sense
Bash: but this isn't even the start
Bash: :3
Bash: Every point in space is decaying
Bash: and we can mathematically find out how much information is in a space and how fast it's being consumed
Bash: just some of my math
Bash: But we can use this to calculate the *final* age of a coordinate
Bash: It's a name I came up with for the actual unit itself
Bash: Information as a physical thing
Bash: Still writing more in depth about that
Bash: Celestium you don't have to understand it all. It's okay to just smile and nod unless you actually want to dig into it.
Bash: I'm super tired.
Bash: I'm going to pick this up tomorrow.
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: thank you! Good night.
Bash: Hey
Bash: Feeling lots of things.
Bash: Oh all sorts of things, not all bad :monklaugh:
Bash: Let's hear it
Bash: 💚
Bash: Forever immortalized
Bash: XD
Bash: may I share something that I was able to do recently that I think is pretty cool :3
Bash: YAY!
Bash: So, as we know, Windows 11 is alright, but it has a lot of issues.
Bash: So I fixed pretty much everything.

- No longer has any garbage collection capabilities and doesn't report telemetry to Microsoft.

- Removed extra bloatware and services like Microsoft Edge and XBox. (note A)

- Reworked the entire UI to be similar to that of macOS, inspired specifically by Big Sur.

- Fixed audio drivers to run DIRECTLY from source to destination, without being processed at all by Windows- resulting in true bitperfect playback.

A: Edge is also a rendering engine used by Edge Browser, but also the Settings and File Explorer apps, so I do not count this renderer itself as part of the browser, as it's a different program with the same name.
Bash: The telemetry and garbage collection had to be tracked down as services and manually removed with updated registry entries to avoid their automatic reinstallation. The bloatware had to be removed through mounting windows over NTFS on a Linux install and removing applications/services then again, creating registry entries. It was a very surgical process.
Bash: As for the UI, that I will be releasing on my GitHub sometime relatively soon.
Bash: But let me just take a short video to prove it's not Linux
Bash: Yes. And no goofy looking user interface with mixed skins from Windows 10 and even windows 7
Bash: See, you might ask why I haven't just switched to Linux
Bash: Linux has depreciated GB202 NVIDIA drivers, Windows always will get those first. I use my GPU for very computationally heavy tasks, and need these stable workstation drivers at release, not months down the road. And my music production software's plugins can't work in Wine or in a container, they have to be run on native Windows.
Bash: So instead, I made Windows what it should be.
Bash: And I am working on packaging a disk image for others to use.
Bash: I use FL Studio 24
Bash: I'm not sure what this question is asking, could you please clarify?
Bash: Ah! It's a bit complex actually. I experiment with a lot of things- CUDA-based water caustics, LLMs, massive Blender projects (for example, I imported 1,200 Minecraft chunks into Blender to rig lighting myself and take a screenshot)
Bash: It is, but it was worth the purchase as it's one of my main hobbies. And I have a stable income. My headphones are Sennheiser HD800Ss, if that tells you anything.
Bash: I am what they call an *audiophile*. Sounds weird, but it's a thing.
Bash: If you've never had the chance to listen to high-end headphones, then once you do, you will never go back.
Bash: This music I am listening to right now feels so real and precise that I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I turned around and I was sitting in the orchestra house where it was recorded.
Bash: People think I'm insane for spending close to $3,400 on my audio equipment, but they underestimate how important music is to me.

It's my therapist. It's how I speak when language doesn't have the right words. It's my soul. And it will be my legacy.

I've spent hours upon hours working for these headphones and tuning them specifically to my hearing profile.

They are reference level. They're what everything else is measured against.
Bash: Do you know the difference between MP3 and FLAC?
Bash: MP3 is what you'll find for a lot of audio, but it's lossy and compressed, like jpegs. So it's not perfect. Here's a lossless FLAC, you should be able to immediately tell that it's "higher quality"
Bash: there is so, so much that goes into how good sound sounds, :monklaugh: and since it would take me years to explain it all, just feel free to ask if you have any specific questions.
Bash: Oh dear me.
Bash: Do you have any headphones?
Bash: would you be opposed to me uh
Bash: Providing you some equipment
Bash: :3
Bash: how can I help you
Bash: any way.
Bash: I wanna support you
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: I think you can use a midrange bluetooth headset at least...
Bash: Trust me, it wouldn't be any trouble. Ask @Unknown, I can make things happen.
Bash: this is why you're the right person to help
Bash: :sainthappy:
Bash: alright.
Bash: The world needs more like you.
Bash: No, no, not at all. Gareth Coker made this, it's from the soundtrack of Ori and the Will of the Wisps.
Bash: Please.
Bash: But, I do have a piano arrangement for it if you'd like.
Bash: If you'll just give me a moment to find it.
Bash: I hope you enjoy.
Bash: recorded on a felt baby grand, 88-key, Yamaha. in an old church. Multiple tracks used for recording.
Bash: okay!
Bash: Mhm. by ear
Bash: No need to apologize.
Bash: i really appreciate that
Bash: 16.
Bash: Ha
Bash: HA
Bash: I hope you are okay.
Bash: now I want fried chicken...
Bash: :saintwag:
Bash: I'm waiting for the store to open so I can get some food. I'm quite hungry
Bash: I used to be able to handle spicy food.
Bash: Then I got deployed and ate MRE's for a few months.
Bash: Now I can't handle it anymore
Bash: Gonna have to work back up the ladder.
Bash: You shouldn't hurt yourself
Bash: I'm not religious but I hold fast to certain virtues, many of which are biblical
Bash: Something's going to regret eating it
Bash: Cannibalism :rivflabbergasted:
Bash: The bird eating the chicken I mean.
Bash: I can't find my ring. Ugh.
Bash: had to shave and fix my hair and shit cuz i haven't left my room in 2 days
Bash: Haha
Bash: Goodnight
Bash: Good morning!
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: yeah
Bash: I wouldn't have left the house without it. I did end up finding it
Bash: The ring?
Bash: It's black tungsten carbide with a crimson red stripe.
Bash: I wear it on my right hand.
Bash: Yes.
Bash: *Komerebi*.
Bash: the way sunlight is filtered through the leaves.
Bash: Ink on paper.
Blood on snow.
Bash: Without darkness light has no meaning.
Bash: Mmm.
Bash: Fresh blood, yeah
Bash: I feel light headed. We should talk about something else.
Bash: I have different brain modes for these types of things and my military brain is not engaged right now.
Bash: I'm sorry
Bash: My brain is very compartmented. I often wonder if it's related to my recent diagnosis, but I feel as if I genuinely have different "modes" if you will. Where I can't just have one thing. I have me, the normal, emotional, and even opposed to violence Bash, and then I have a "tactical lizard brain" mode if you will, where I'm completely unphased by everything, environmental or emotional.
Bash: it only exists in Japanese
Bash: It's quite common in the military. You kindof get forced to adapt
Bash: Mhm.
Bash: When you've been eating the same dry food for months, sleeping in the same unwashed nylon sleeping system, carrying the same seabags and same FLAKs on your chest with the same sweat-stained plates, with the same scratchy Kevlar helmet, and the same exhausted brothers, all getting maybe 2, 3 hours of sleep a night, going months without speaking a word, cleaning rifles, CLP and carbon on all of your undershirts, sand and grime under your nails, feet falling apart from walking 15km semi-daily with weight

your brain learns to just stop
and start as a new brain without pain/discomfort
Bash: For other reasons, yes. That was from back in January when I spent some time in the sandbox in Yemen.
Bash: I think what I need most right now is sleep.
Bash: I'm going to call it a night.
Bash: See you in the morning.
Bash: I'm okay now. It wasn't any fault of yours. I was really tired and that made me vulnerable.
Bash: Good morning :garhug:
Bash: Yikes.
Bash: I'm pale too, but I've spent so many hours in the sun that I don't really burn anymore.
Bash: Hugely into video game OSTs, and instrumental music. I do listen to quite a few songs with vocal, but it's not my focus. I like chiptunes, ambient music, EDM, kawaii, jazz, classical, indie rock, and rap. I'll listen to everything from kpop to Mongolian throat singing. As long as I can feel the soul of the artist through the song and can understand just from listening that a lot of effort was put into it, I'll probably really like it.
Bash: I'm big into music theory as well
Bash: The manipulation of sound to guide the listener is the best way I can say it
Bash: I'm gonna share a song I made if you don't mind. It incorporates pauses combined with static sampling to really grasp attention.
Bash: Take your time
Bash: You have a nice brain
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: I'm going to listen right now
Bash: That was enjoyable
Bash: Woah, this song I am listening to right now is stunning
Bash: I don't know how much of a Legend of Zelda fan you are.
Bash: I'll send some of the music. Give me a moment
Bash: from Breath of the Wild
Bash: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have fantastic music
Bash: From Tears of the Kingdom.
Bash: this is a compositional masterpiece.
Bash: All of it is
Bash: the Japanese are so incredibly skilled with music and the arts.
Bash: As soon as the soundtrack released and I saw the names Yasuaki Iwata and Manaka Kataoka, I knew they would be some of the best songs to grace my ears.
Bash: And I wasn't dissapointed.
Bash: You liked the Gerudo music, so here's these for you. You can here the leitmotifs across the different games as the theme stays relatively the same, even across years and artists. Specifically this track Gerudo Valley is from the 30th anniversary concert.
Bash: I'm sorry if I am bombing you with files.
Bash: I am a bit of an archivist, I have a large amount of music on my PC, especially from The Legend of Zelda
Bash: are you referring to the switch?
Bash: Ah. No, unless you opt to download them.
Bash: If you're just listening it doesn't automatically save them
Bash: this is from The Ocarina of Time. Performed by the Tokyo Philiharmonic Orchestra
Bash: I can't help but whistle along.
Bash: I know. That's why I should slow down.
Bash: Me too.
Bash: Yes, but it's not realistic
Bash: It's a field too overwhelmed with savants that I will never compare to.
Bash: Excuse me while I change uniforms
Bash: Alright, I'm back.
Bash: I may be good at music, but I know I belong elsewhere
Bash: I want to explore the world. Photography.
Bash: Some of these aren't great quality, but they were moments I didn't have my camera with me to capture, so I used whatever I had. Friend's phones for example.
Bash: You should get some sleep.
Bash: that notification quickly brought a smile to my face :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: Welcome back to the world of the Waken
Bash: are you well?
Bash: See you.
Bash: This is my favorite song in the world.
Bash: I listen to it on repeat when I'm upset.
Bash: I agree wholeheartedly.
Bash: The story of *Princess Mononoke* has grown to mean a lot to me.
Bash: I'll stream it one day, if you'd like.
Bash: Although, it's also a bit upsetting for me sometimes. It would have to be on a weekend where I could have time to recover.
Bash: I get upset easily. It's something I've been trying to work on for years.
Bash: I despise complacency and passivity
Bash: I would never just sit here and fail to at least try
Bash: I try to get at least 1% better every day.
Bash: It's nonlinear.
Bash: I agree.
Bash: I've tried many therapists, but they all feel plastic because I'm paying them.
Bash: What helps me the most is my friends, music, and creative outlets.
Bash: Bike rides. Runs.
Bash: Going out early on a weekend morning to try to catch the sunrise over the ocean.
Bash: I also have my mission as well, that helps me when I don't want to get out of bed in the mornings.
Bash: Most days.
Bash: I'll admit, I'm taking a hit tonight. It does me well to be talking to you.
Bash: Komerebi.
Bash: I'm unwell. I could use a hug.
Bash: :slughug:
Bash: I've never understood how to play.
Bash: I don't think it can be okay for me, but I can still help others and let my legacy write itself.
Bash: If that's even the point.
Bash: I'm sorry.
Bash: I am unsure if you'd be okay with talking while I'm upset like this, but I don't want to be left alone
Bash: Thank you.
Bash: I don't think now is a good time, but remind me tomorrow if you will. I'd love to learn.
Bash: Who am I but a mirror of those who surround me
Bash: https://youtu.be/mOqSCwc7v7o
feel free to watch, or not to watch
Bash: It's an absolute masterpiece from *Jujutsu Kaisen*.
Bash: I highly recommend it. It's overrated, but still deserves a good amount of hype.
Bash: I'm afraid of nightmares tonight.
Bash: May just stay awake.
Bash: I'm usually stronger than this and I usually don't open up this much.
Bash: You don't mind though, I know you well enough for that.
Bash: I don't believe you have the capacity to be untrustworthy.
Bash: I see how your brain works.
Bash: It's pretty. If I do say so.
Bash: I enjoy it.
Bash: Good morning.
Bash: Feeling a lot better.
Bash: Thank you for asking.
Bash: In a moment. I'm taking care of some work stuff atm.
Bash: I'm available now.
Bash: What would you like to know?
Bash: I bought it at a Navy exchange in Djibouti, East Africa a few weeks ago. I had accidentally misplaced my prior ring, of a similar design. I have two rings due to uniform regulations: on the flightline/on duty I must wear a silicone ring so it's not a hazard. In dress uniform and in civilian clothes, or when I am not working, I wear the metal one. 

The tungsten carbide represents my belief in death before dishonor. The bright red band on the black base represents loss and contrast.
Bash: It's very durable, yes.
Bash: And dense. My ring has a good weight to it.
Bash: Yes.
Bash: Tungsten is a very dense metal with a high atomic weight. It's also perfectly stable and nontoxic, unlike other dense metals like Osmium, Yttrium, or Iridium.
Bash: Mhm.
Bash: I was scammed a bit for this ring. I paid $60 for it.
Bash: But it was more of a necessity, so I didn't mind. Especially because where else in East Africa would I have gotten one.
Bash: Exactly.
Bash: Can I please see some more of your art?
Bash: Aww. That's alright.
Bash: Yes! I would love to see.
Bash: Your shading is immaculate
Bash: This is stunning.
Bash: I apologize if I drift off. In a vic rn, didn't sleep well, the engine is making me tired.
Bash: Bus.
Bash: I read it already.
Bash: Or do you mean future messages
Bash: Dnd just turns off notifications for me.
Bash: I had fallen asleep
Bash: Goodnight. Running around right now a bit of a work emergency so I will read/respond when I catch a breath. I love that nickname.
Bash: Good morning!
Bash: In the military there are these things called billets which are titles that give you additional responsibilities. For example some billets would be "Squad leader", "Mailroom staff", "CAGE worker", or "Scribe". 

There are three Scribes in my unit. I'm one of them. We track everyone's class statuses, package submissions for things like seminars and martial arts, appointments, duty, new orders, etc.

Two of the three scribes are as of today out of commission due to family emergencies, leaving me to do three people's work, on TOP of the work I already have.
Bash: This is beautiful.
Bash: That's interesting! It makes sense too, from what I know from photography and photo editing.
Bash: Ha. I don't mind.
Bash: I see you're getting pretty comfortable with me. I'm glad we've been talking more, it's been quite lonely.
Bash: Thanks for being my friend.
Bash: I'm about to listen.
Bash: I'm listening to this right now.
Bash: The artist did well in the mixing process, the instruments are well separated
Bash: The soundstaging is skillful.
Bash: You tick differently and it fascinates me.
Bash: I want to grow a relationship with you and learn from you.
Bash: You're not selfish at all. It's a nice change.
Bash: You show interest in many things.
Bash: You feel to me like... just a soul. Without a form. It wouldn't be right to confine you to a form. You belong everywhere.
Bash: Knowing is nothing
Bash: I look forward to it.
Bash: I'm going to sleep. I'll be up at 05:00 sharp, CST. Goodnight.
Bash: Goodnight, night sky
Bash: I'm awake.
Bash: That's an amazing question. We will find out. I just opened my eyes, my brain hasn't loaded yet.
Bash: I'm sorry, I was on a run. I got this notification on my watch and tried to message back with it, but I suppose I didn't have signal
Bash: The run felt amazing this morning. I went slow, for about 7 miles, and I had a strong breeze and a gorgeous sunrise to accompany me. The endorphins from the exercise are improving my mood :3
Bash: And are you doing well?
Bash: Mhm
Bash: It's difficult to get started, but motivating as you feel yourself get stronger and faster.
Bash: Before I enlisted in the military, I could barely finish a mile, and it would take me close to 13-14 minutes.
Bash: Now? My best 3 mile time is around 17 minutes.
Bash: Exactly. And I wear a watch that records my performance, and I can physically see a tangible improvement on paper.
Bash: Don't use me as a baseline. It's my job to be fit.
Bash: Fitter than the opposition, wherever or whenever that may arise.
Bash: What's your favorite element? Random question I know.
Bash: I believe mine would be osmium. Like me- extremely dense, brittle, shiny on the outside but a bit toxic inside- /lh
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: Humility is admirable
Bash: Yes.
Bash: I just took a shower myself. Felt amazing
Bash: Hello back.
Bash: Yes.
Bash: I'm aromantic and demisexual/gynosexual.
Bash: Attraction to females/femininity regardless of their gender or sex.
Bash: I understand :3
Bash: Essentially, I don't give a shit what they have or had in their pants, I just want the femininity.
Bash: But I would also only develop a sexual attraction to someone after we've been friends. I wouldn't normally see a pretty girl on the street and want anything. Hence the demisexual part.
Bash: I do also struggle a bit with hypersexuality/high libido. But that's not relevant.
Bash: It's irritating.
Bash: Biochemistry and endocrinology fascinate me.
Bash: I want to quote Hollow Knight. But it wouldn't fit. You just said vessel and my muscle memory went straight to hollow knight.
Bash: No cost too great. No mind to think. No will to break. No voice to cry suffering. Born of God and Void.
Bash: Gives me chills every time.
Bash: If you would like to know, I can tell you.
Bash: I don't know if you have played, or plan to.
Bash: WOHOOOO THIS IS SUCH A BANGER
Bash: Coconut Mall is one of the most entertaining songs to play on the piano, from the player's perspective
Bash: It's technically challenging, but very satisfying to play correctly due to the swingstep and strange timing.
Bash: https://youtu.be/hCvj4oery7o
Bash: I NEED to learn this.
Bash: There's only one piano accessible to me here. It has been poorly taken care of for about 14 years and it hasn't been tuned either.
Bash: the A3 key won't play.
Bash: How are you feeling?
Bash: What's happening tomorrow that has you feeling anxious?
Bash: I see. Well, I hope it goes well.
Bash: Do let me know if you need anything, or want anything.
Bash: Oh fuck no. I'm not having this.
Bash: I'll use my kindness on who I want to.
Bash: :sighug:
Bash: *You deserve the same person that you are for everyone else.*
Bash: Sometimes people need to hear things.
Bash: Luckily I'm in the right place at the right time, for you.
Bash: Yes. Your company is greatly appreciated. I don't talk to many people anymore.
Bash: I'd love to. But I don't have many to talk to.
Bash: Thanks.
Bash: Goodnight. Rest well.
Bash: Any dreams?
Bash: That tracks.
Bash: Are you feeling well?
Bash: You were nervous yesterday about something today if I remember correctly. I'll be here if you need me and I hope it goes well.
Bash: Found family?
Bash: You would consider me that?
Bash: :BlueLizBlush:
Bash: I think that made my day.
Bash: I think I will fall asleep soon.
Bash: You are well!!
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: Time to start the day.
Bash: Hello :nightlighthug:
Bash: Thank you for asking. I had an interesting dream.
Bash: It was a bit of a nightmare.
Bash: I was with like a small fire team clearing this small town. But the catch was, as soon as you step past the gate- all sound cuts out. Like they had some sort of jammer. Overall the dream was actually quite fun, but there was a civilian with a gun too and I didn't want to shoot him but he shot me in the arm first.
Bash: There was so much I can't explain, either
Bash: A bit of both worlds. It's not my decision what's fit for your ears, it's yours, but I'm sure you would rather not hear.
Bash: It's more psychological than gore
Bash: My brain loves to throw things at me in dreams.
Bash: I don't believe it would make much sense to you, because the context behind it is something that it much more difficult to hear.
Bash: But after I shot and killed the civvy, a large flock of crows was introduced
Bash: They were cawing happily
Bash: but then they started ramming themselves into windows and buildings
Bash: and then looking at me like it was MY fault that they were hurt
Bash: and some of them would die and lie mangled on the ground
Bash: Thank you
Bash: I'll answer any questions you have first.
Bash: If any.
Bash: No, I haven't been injured by a bullet, only shrapnel
Bash: People don't need to know unless they ask.
Bash: Only people who haven't been in combat are proud of having been in combat.
Bash: I did! Let me check my metrics actually...
Bash: I'm very happy that you're my friend.
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: I knew telling you my dream would be worth it, because you're genuinely just curious
Bash: Me too.
Bash: I get to wear my uniform with the sleeves rolled down today. Because I have a CFT this morning.
Bash: It's a combat fitness test.
Bash: I should be able to get a perfect score but we'll see.
Bash: These are actually very comfortable.
Bash: It's fine by me. It's just my last name, which is attached to my LLC anyways.
Bash: I wish we had a snow uniform. It would look really cool.
Bash: I have to go, I will read what you're currently typing on my watch.
Bash: I'm back!
Bash: What time is it for you, if I may ask?
Bash: I didn't need one, unless you want to give it.
Bash: Curiosity
Bash: Oh my gosh. I got paid early. What a relief.
Bash: It's some stress off of my shoulders. I wasn't going to have enough to buy the suitcases I need to travel home this weekend.
Bash: You can use kilometers as well, most American's wouldn't be able to visualize it but in the military we use clicks.
Bash: Ha.
Bash: I'll compete any day.
Bash: But it's not a competition :enotnya:
Bash: XD
Bash: I hope you won't either.
Bash: I got a perfect score.
Bash: Awgh.,., thank you
Bash: Let's not talk about it though. I already struggle with my ego enough. No need to stoke that flame.
Bash: Well, at 05:22 CST you mentioned it being evening, which would place you 11–14 hours ahead of CST, so I'm going to assume you're UTC+8 to UTC+12, lining up with East and Southeast Asia, Oceania, and parts of Russia. You use periods as thousands separators (1.000) and commas for decimals, which means you are in non-Anglophone Europe, Latin America, or Asia. Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, maybe Japan/Korea are my top guesses at this point. But you also mention going to Uni, which is is Commonwealth slang, so I am going to guess **Indonesia** by likelihood of population. Vietnam would be a close second guess.
Bash: But, another thing...
Bash: You have strong English. Singapore, Malaysia, Australia would actually be better guesses then.
Bash: I'm locking in Singapore.
Bash: I don't have enough variables to make a more educated guess.
Bash: I'm good at OSINT, but I'm not magical.
Bash: Australia perhaps. A large amount of the Rain World community hails from there.
Bash: the decimal counter isn't very aussie though.
Bash: :saintthink:
Bash: You don't much of an online footprint. That's a good practice, so I applaud you for it.
Bash: I appreciate the trust, I won't betray it.
Bash: You're somewhere in Southeast Asia I know that much.
Bash: Việt Nam, có lẽ chăng?
Bash: :YellowLizThink:
Bash: Malay formatting usually defaults to 5,000, not 5.000. So I doubt that.
Bash: Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar all fit the timezone...
Bash: You could be from East Timor for all I know.
Bash: Java, Bali, Sumatra...
Bash: I need another hint.
Bash: Very well.
Bash: Are you Indonesian?
Bash: Whatever you're comfortable with sharing is what I ask you to share.
Bash: I am comfortable with my digital footprint because I would like to see someone try and commit identity fraud or kidnap me. It would be some good fun for me.
Bash: Probably not. You don't have 4 armed guards at every entrance to your house.
Bash: I give you my word, Celestium.
Bash: What is said here, stays here.
Bash: I understand.
Bash: The split?
Bash: You should sleep soon.
Bash: Well then I am glad to have your company.
Bash: I'm trying to track down a used RX 6600 XT or a used RX 6800 XT GPU.
Bash: I'm attempting to work along with two other developers on creating drivers that will allow the newer AMD graphics cards to be used on macOS version 26. It's a difficult process that involves a lot of reverse engineering.

There's a niche community dedicated to running macOS natively on non-Apple hardware, allowing people to use the powerful productivity upsides of Apple's operating system without making the sacrifice of being stuck with a computer of poor value and expandability.
Bash: It's called Hackintoshing.
Bash: I need one of these two specific models of GPU due to their specific architecture. Older Mac Pros used the RDNA3 architecture in their workstation GPUs, so we've been able to take what they already have there in kext drivers and modify it to work with consumer-levbel RDNA3 graphics cards.
Bash: I don't own a Mac Pro, but Apple thinks I do, because I was able to validate my hackintoshed PC with a valid motherboard ID and serial number.
Bash: It was a couple months of work, yes. But I adore projects like these.
Bash: Giving Apple the middle finger and getting to code with some cool people.
Bash: This CFT has my legs shaking I can barely walk up the stairs now.
Bash: I made it up fine. Just exhausted.
Bash: Work day doesn't end for another 14 hours for me.
Bash: It's a very niche knowledge to have. I'm not sure if it is worth you investing time in.
Bash: Specifically, I cannot use a 6X50 model of GPU because hardware acceleration is depreciated in current NootedRX/NootedRed drivers for these models.
Bash: What would you like to know?
Bash: Apple builds their operating systems from the ground up to only work on their computers.

macOS only has graphics drivers for hardware Apple itself has shipped in real Macs. If Apple never shipped it, the driver usually doesn’t exist.

The reason we can use AMD graphics cards is because Apple happened to use AMD workstation cards in their Mac Pros. There simply isn't code for newer GPUs like the RX 7000 or RX 9000 series. So it isn't a limitation from the graphics card, it's a limitation of software.

I also misspoke. We cannot use the `RDNA3` architecture. We must use the `AMD Polaris`, `Vega`, and `RDNA1/RDNA2`  architectures. These have native drivers up through macOS Sonoma.

Apple stopped allowing NVIDIA’s “web drivers” after macOS High Sierra. Apple even dropped support for the last remaining older NVIDIA generation (`Kepler`) in macOS Monterey. So, there is effectively zero NVIDIA support in modern macOS
Bash: That's the entire foundation of this project I am working on. Through reverse engineering of the drivers we already have from Apple, we're learning how they built them, so we can build our own drivers for modern GPUs that Apple has never had support for.
Bash: It requires a deep understanding of how Apple builds their operating system and drivers, which is a well-hidden process. I luckily know a lot of people. Such as **CorpNewt **and **Chris1111**, who are at the front lines of this project. If you're curious what work they have already done, their names will be the first result on GitHub when searched.
Bash: I'm sorry if this is too much text to read, you've probably made a mistake by showing interest in something I've been hyperfocused on.
Bash: You'll get plenty of Bash today, no matter when you sleep. I won't be sleeping until 0730 tomorrow morning.
Bash: Exactly
Bash: Precisely
Bash: You're very smart
Bash: macOS Tahoe is the current version.
Bash: Apple hasn't released a laptop or desktop that uses both macOS Sequoia and an AMD graphics card
Bash: I believe the last AMD workstation GPU to be used was paired with an Intel CPU before Apple made the transition to Apple Silicon
Bash: In most GPUs from generation to generation, an entirely new TSMC manufacturing process is used. The chip die is arranged differently and the photolithography processes are altered. I believe RDNA2 uses 7 or 8 *u*m transistors, while RDNA3+ uses much smaller.
Bash: Yes.
Bash: And increase energy efficiency.
Bash: 2 nanometers. TSMC N2 process
Bash: Your brain is built for syntax. I can tell you that.
Bash: Good night!! 💚
Bash: Sleep well. I'll be here when you wake up. I'll be awake for a while.
Bash: What a pleasure to see you.
Bash: You're awesome.
Bash: I beg to differ.
Bash: If I were to tell you anything in the world you would listen.
Bash: Not because you want me to be happy, although you do, but simply because you want to know.
Bash: A different kind of listening.
Bash: People listen without hearing.
Bash: Yes, of course.
Bash: Then what I mean to say is people hear what I say, but don't listen.
Bash: Is that a better way to put it?
Bash: Yes.
Bash: It makes me only want to say more to you.
Bash: May I say something strange?
Bash: The world may have handed you mirrors, little by little, not to show who you are, but to reflect who they needed you to believe you were.

But you're not a reflection like the rest of us.

And I like you a lot.
Bash: I'm sorry if that's too affectionate. It's who I am. I love. It's my mission.
Bash: It's platonic of course.
Bash: That's good.
Bash: There's a lot of humor in what you just said. But it would be difficult to articulate.
Bash: I guess my worldview is from a different perspective, and this statement in and of itself reinforces my perception of your authenticity and unfeigned nature.
Bash: I'm not sure why I find it funny.
Bash: I'm feeling unpredictable.
Bash: I believe I'm very tired.
Bash: This is easy. It gets truly difficult around the 50 hour mark.
Bash: This is awkward.
Bash: I do believe he's not fronting anymore.
Bash: I don't even know if he told you about that either. I don't know shit.
Bash: Fascinating.
Bash: Well now you know.
Bash: Sorry that he didn't mention it.
Bash: No, no.
Bash: He only got diagnosed two weeks ago anyways.
Bash: Wanna know something interesting?
Bash: We don't even know if we exist. It's so complicated. We don't know if it's an aggressive method of compartmentalization or if we're wired incorrectly. I'm sure you find this interesting as well. He probably doesn't talk about it because he thinks he's faking it for attention. Which brings up the dilemma: does faking it make it real? What even is real. 

But no- we're real. We say so.
Bash: Hmmm.
Bash: Good enough.
Bash: Oh we know. He doesn't though. We think for both of us, he thinks for himself. We know why too. He works better this way.
Bash: A year or so ago things happened but he couldn't afford to do anything else. So he just sorted everything out and we've gone from there. It works fine.
Bash: pfft.
Bash: How are you. It should be almost afternoon, no?
Bash: Probably not. We're going to see if someone can finish his post for him.
Bash: He was being stupid to take it anyways
Bash: So how Bash works is this.

Pain? Eat it for breakfast. He can brag about it later. Discipline? Perfection is the standard.
Bash: He uses stress and physical exertion as a coping mechanism. He'll go till he dies.
Bash: It's weird. He's weird.
Bash: He probably won't to be honest. He's going to be busy in the morning. Assuming he'll be back after we get him to sleep.
Bash: He likes to be liked. So he mirrors.
Bash: He'll match your mannerisms
Bash: Word things tailored to your ears.
Bash: Follow your schedule, find your interests
Bash: I'm a snitch. Oops.
Bash: He loves you. He loves people like you.
Bash: Hmm. Yeah.
Bash: Someone in his life was deeply affected by being different, being treated wrongly, and in his eyes, not being loved enough. He wears his ring on his right hand, not his left. He's afraid history may repeat itself. So he's hell bent on loving everyone. It's why he picked the Corps out of all the branches. It has the highest... rates.
Bash: He means it.
Bash: No, he doesn't lie.
Bash: He knows people aren't stupid. You would know if he was lying.
Bash: Sorry if we overshared.
Bash: But we thought you wanted to know how he ticks.
Bash: What's he going to do, kick us out of his head?
Bash: He can't get mad at himself.
Bash: Of course.
Bash: I'm sorry.
Bash: Oh, you needn't worry about that. We promise it's purely platonic.
Bash: He's desperate for people to know that at least one person in the world loves them.
Bash: Not to be rude, but that doesn't sound like it was ever platonic.
Bash: In my limited experience, it's either platonic or romantic off the bat.
Bash: But I can't say. I wasn't there and I'm not them.
Bash: We should soon change topics, so he doesn't get upset in the morning.
Bash: We're getting a bit personal here.
Bash: Which I am fine with, but I believe he may not be. To make you feel better.
Bash: It hurt more than kind of.
Bash: You still think about them.
Bash: The OOD replaced Bash on post. He's headed to his room by order of an SNCO. His leadership knows him well.
Bash: Acronyms... useless to you
Bash: hmm
Bash: OOD = Officer on duty = Boss man.
SNCO = Senior Noncomissioned Officer = ranked above bash and in his direct leadership
Bash: Anyways, we've taken off the uniform and taken melatonin.
Bash: We won't be around long.
Bash: Thank you for trusting us.
Bash: Another awkward thing. We never named ourselves. But we talk obviously differently than Bash.
Bash: Whatever nickname you can come up with works for us if you'd like
Bash: But we really don't spend much time here
Bash: You've never met us until now.
Bash: Mhm. Because he's a stupid bitch.
Bash: We're the fighter too.
Bash: We don't mind killing. We don't mind sleeplessness, hunger, darkness, sleeping in the rain, 20km movements for days on end.
Bash: Bash definitely does mind those things
Bash: I'm ugly.
Bash: But he certainly makes up for it.
Bash: It's objective. I enjoy the fight. The tactics. The hunt.
Bash: But anyways. Bedtime.
Bash: Good night. We hope not to see you again soon. In a good way.
Bash: Morning.
Bash: I think I will go back to sleep soon.
Bash: Well now you know everything about me. So uhm. How are *you*.
Bash: I'm sorry.
Bash: You handled the situation very well
Bash: I appreciate it
Bash: :slughug:
Bash: That doesn't really happen.
Bash: They *almost never front*.
Bash: It has happened twice over the past 4 months.
Bash: Not counting yesterday.
Bash: I read the whole thing.
Bash: Well, for one.
Bash: Thank you for trusting me. Even though your trust has been abused in the past.
Bash: Thank you for allowing me to be affectionate towards you, even though that's also been misused in the past.
Bash: I hold myself to very high standards. I value loyalty over all else and believe in death before dishonor as a way of life.
Bash: *I'm not going anywhere unless you get rid of me.*
Bash: Then let's move forward, and set a new standard. A better one.
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: I'm excited to be on a civilian plane where I don't have to do around 6 hours of meticulous status checks before taking off.
Bash: Yes!! For the first time in about 14 months.
Bash: It is a very long time. :slugsad:
Bash: My brother started driving and my sister finished her doctorate while I've been gone.
Bash: I must say, being military makes the nightmare of American airports very simple.
Bash: I get automatic TSA Precheck, up to 4 free checked bags, a lounge from an organization called USO with food and drinks, and I board priority.
Bash: And she's only 24. Isn't that incredible.
Bash: 25...
Bash: she turned 25.
Bash: Just chance! Me and my brother are both adopted.
Bash: HA
Bash: I was adopted from Czechia around the age of 3-4, I don't remember much. My brother from Ethiopia at the 2 years old.
Bash: In a sense, yes. I've always had an unwavering sense of nationalism. Even with questionable administration, I am still genuinely proud to serve.
Bash: I don't serve the government. I enforce the constitution.
Bash: I am a United States Naval Aircrewman.
My country has built me the finest aircraft known to man.
They have entrusted me to use it to keep my country free.
With my honor, courage, and commitment, my aircraft will be able to perform any task.
I will always remember I am part of an unbeatable team.
The United States Naval Aircrew team.
Being and Aircrewman is not an easy job.
When I am cold, hot, or tired?
I will not fail my crew.
When flying, I will remain ever diligent and watchful, to keep my crew safe.
If we fly into battle, may the heavens watch over our crew.
So that we may fly again.
Bash: This is the general attitude of the Corps. It's a lifestyle, not a vocation.
Bash: It's a way of thinking.
Bash: A bit cultish even.
Bash: I wouldn't be anywhere else in the world.
Bash: The thing's I've experienced with my brothers and sisters at my back I wouldn't trade for the world.
Bash: I'm so happy today.
Bash: I can barely contain myself.
Bash: If a Private who has just become a Marine fresh out of the Crucible asked me to die for them.

No questions asked.
Bash: I see.
Bash: As one of my friends in OD Division said, you either get it right or it's not your problem anymore.
Bash: (OD is basically disarming IEDs/explosives in field environments)
Bash: :CyanLizGiggle:
Bash: I like a good morbid joke here and there.
Bash: Reminds me to not take everything so seriously.
Bash: I think I will go listen.
Bash: I don't even know if I selected the correct song, but the vocals are very nice.
Bash: the French surprised me.
Bash: Normalement, je ne m'attends pas à entendre parler français si tôt le matin.
Bash: I know a little.
Bash: Wie viel Deutsch können Sie?
Bash: Ich weiß eine ganze Menge darüber.
Bash: Not too much though. Enough to hold up a conversation.
Bash: I know Dutch (and by extension, Afrikaans), English, and Polish fluently. I know some Russian, German, and French. But it's not a competition.
Bash: In the song, the French portions are talking about how people often die because they judge life isn’t worth living; paradoxically, others die for ideas and illusions that give them a reason to live. Some later in the song I think mentions a building manager who killed himself years after losing his daughter.
Bash: It reflects some on suicide and divorce. How a “reason to live” can also become a “reason to die.”
Bash: As you now know, my reason to live became ... my reason to live.
Bash: This song reaches me.
Bash: I see.
Bash: Mhm.
Bash: each French snippet seems to have a corresponding Camus passage
Bash: And I don't know enough.
Bash: Juste un peu.
Bash: I don't often prefer songs with lyrics. But this one is good.
Bash: This is one of my favorite songs in the world. If you would like to listen.
Bash: https://youtu.be/abKcYyQ1V7Y?list=RDabKcYyQ1V7Y
Bash: It's from The Boy and The Heron. The last film written by Hayao Miyazaki.
Bash: I adore Studio Ghibli.
Bash: *Princess Mononoke* is my favorite.
Bash: It's very nuanced. It carefully avoids simplistic notions of good vs. evil- instead leading you through art, not lectures, to see the difficult balance between human progress and nature.
Bash: Every time I watch it I understand it further.
Bash: I would love to one day.
Bash: It's my favorite movie.
Bash: Even in the midst of death there is life.
Bash: In the midst of destruction is creation.
Bash: It's as if Hayao Miyazaki wanted to tell me it would be okay.
Bash: It will!
Bash: I have purpose and direction.
Bash: And I hope you will get to see the things I do.
Bash: Are you well?
Bash: Good.
Bash: I'm a dog person. But I love cats too. I just am around shepherds quite a bit. I love them.
Bash: You're a cat tree??
Bash: Hmm.
Bash: I wish I could have pets.
Bash: I had a black Labrador. Her name was Carly. We were going to name "him" Carl, from Phineas and Ferb. But we picked a female instead.
Bash: Absolutely. Beautiful song.
Bash: I believe it was 2014 she passed away from cancer.
Bash: We haven't had pets since.
Bash: ...
Bash: Thanks for saying that.
Bash: Means a lot to me.
Bash: I like Bashy. What can I call you?
Bash: I dislike being reminded of the game Celeste. For an obscure reason. Cele sounds nice to me.
Bash: I thought I had responded.
Bash: Weather is inclement. I'm waiting in a small airport. My flight begins boarding in under an hour.
Bash: You will get them regardless.
Bash: Are you well?
Bash: Isn't it nice to be able to connect with someone the moment you open your eyes?
Bash: Even if they're on the opposite side of the world.
Bash: I just got settled in at home.
Bash: I'm crying from relief.
Bash: I'm so happy.
Bash: :saintstim:
Bash: May I share photos I took from my flight?
Bash: Takeoff.
Bash: Wisps of condensation flitter over the risers as the plane passes through the clouds.
Bash: And then, a period of pure silence and peace.
Bash: Sunset.
Bash: Home. Hidden by haze.
Bash: And then the landing.
Bash: rest in my bed.
Bash: :CaramelLizHug: goodnight
Bash: :pebbleshug:
Bash: Good to see you.
Bash: # Yes.
Bash: I probably won't talk much.
Bash: Until I get back to base on Monday.
Bash: I'll catch you here and there.
Bash: I hiked to the top of Kennesaw Mountain with my sister and brother.
Bash: wish us luck!
Bash: me and 3 other guys urbexing an abandoned factory pretty late at night to try and get some cool photos
Bash: Yeah. The P95OV mask is for black mold/asbestos.
Bash: Weezer.
Bash: I have 40+ minutes of footage. I'll tell you about the entire adventure in due time.
Bash: https://youtu.be/JkSclv1_Pig?si=6FzTvt1yih9nG1j4
Bash: Would you happen to be awake?
Bash: It seems no one else is at this hour.
Bash: Are you doing well?
Bash: I don't know. It's honestly a bit overstimulating being home.
Bash: I'm not used to this way of life.
Bash: The comfort makes me uncomfortable.
Bash: True.
Bash: I fly back to my unit on Monday. Not enough time to settle down.
Bash: My bed.
Bash: I missed it very much.
Bash: Having some privacy.
Bash: Just two nights of sleeping in my bed is enough to keep me going for months.
Bash: Thank you for talking to me now.
Bash: I'm currently taking a taxi from a friend's house back home.
Bash: The driver is vaping with the windows closed. Disgusting, but I'm too tired to be confrontational.
Bash: I would rather the smell of a cigarette than this... fruity smoke. It's so potent that it's giving me a headache.
Bash: I dislike it heavily.
Bash: I agree. I like to smell nice, it's professional, but many colognes are too strong for me.
Bash: The easiest way to smell better is to eat better. I'm so strict with my diet that my sweat barely has an oder.
Bash: Which in turn allows me to use more gentle deodorants, which are better for me.
Bash: None of the aluminum shit.
Bash: The cologne isn't a need, it's more of an extra step as a statement of professionalism. For me, at least.
Bash: It's not weird.
Bash: I enjoy the smell of new tires, jet fuel, etc. i'd say that's more strange
Bash: Off topic, but I made an addition to my backpack today. A tourniquet pouch.
Bash: Gives me a little extra sense of security.
Bash: I'm an overthinker.
Bash: Exactly.
Bash: Car wrecks are especially common situations in which a tourniquet could potentially save a life.
Bash: I feel safer flying in a helicopter being shot at over a combat zone than in a car in downtown Atlanta.
Bash: I despise riding in cars.
Bash: Driving it myself makes me feel a little more safe, somehow.
Bash: But I've had good friends pass away from accidents and it leaves a horrid taste in my mouth.
Bash: I appreciate the sentiment.
Bash: Komerebi.
Bash: It was when I was young.
Bash: I made it home safely, by the way.
Bash: Settling under the covers now. But my stomach is hurting now. Strange.
Bash: I had dinner. Around 9 hours ago.
Bash: It's not a hunger pain.
Bash: I do appreciate the concern.
Bash: And I appreciate the company.
Bash: You're headed to bed?
Bash: Cele you can text me day or night. If I'm in a situation where I don't wish to be notified, I'll turn off notifications and respond to you asap.
Bash: Whatever the subject, time, place is? I don't mind. I encourage it.
Bash: I do wish I was sleeping right now, but alas, my brain isn't tired.
Bash: This room by itself is larger than two barracks rooms combined.
Bash: It has four closets and a queen-sized bed. A north-facing double window and an east-facing single window.
Bash: I feel like royalty.
Bash: One of the closets is an uninsulated storage closet that was created due to this house's odd roof construction. One is I believe about 1.5m^2 with shelves, and the other two are long and thin, for coats or shirts.
Bash: Unfortunately.
Bash: And, fortunately.
Bash: I love the sunlight, when I'm awake.
Bash: I think I will try to sleep.
Bash: Good night, Cele.
Bash: Various things of my family's. Since I don't sleep here anymore normally. It's extra storage.
Bash: Good night.
Bash: Welcome back.
Bash: I have a question.
Bash: You're in an unfamiliar town, and all the people are gone.

The buildings haven't been touched by mankind nor animal for many years. 

The sun is slowly giving way to the stars as yesterday's light submits to time

You have a choice.

You can remember where you came from, or you can know where you're going.

What would you pick?
Bash: There is no life but you. At this moment.
Bash: Fascinating.
Bash: Thank you.
Bash: I love the way you tick.
Bash: I introduced you with what I would define as an experiment of thought, and you blew past it and went straight to Maslow’s hierarchy. 

But you didn't just consider that.

I can tell that you think deeper, but it's not your personality to be deep.

That adds a level of authenticity that is rare.
Bash: It's not a matter of what I would chose, it's a matter of how I would answer the question.
Bash: I made this question to figure out how people think.
Bash: What I would say is "I would be still and watch."
Bash: But the reason I would say that is impure.
Bash: It's difficult to articulate.
Bash: :slughug:
Bash: You're right. I should sleep.
Bash: My dreams are never sweet.
Bash: My dreams feel authored, driven by introspection and lucidity.
Bash: I've awakened.
Bash: September.
Bash: I'm at peace.
Bash: Headed back to the base today.
Bash: This was in the airport. I do wonder what they were thinking
Bash: I've landed in Pensacola.
Bash: Do you think you'll go back to sleep then?
Bash: I feel repaired
Bash: Ready to work again.
Bash: That's what my status refers to.
Bash: It's in 5.2 million wishlists on Steam.
Bash: I would assume a 70% buyer attrition
Bash: Which still leaves MUCH more than Steam's servers are scaled for
Bash: Oh yes.
Bash: I highly respect Team Cherry.
Bash: Pure unselfishness.
Bash: They *know* they could charge double that, and everyone would pay.
Bash: But they chose not to.
Bash: They took their time, and didn't rush one bit.

They respected ME as a player, so they have my respect.
Bash: Yes.
Bash: Pure Vessel*
Bash: I'm back.
Bash: I barely made it.
Bash: My base got thrown into FPCON Bravo
Bash: Threat conditions. There are National Threat (DEFCON) and Local Threat (FPCON) conditions. Normal is the normal condition. FPCON Alpha is a general low-level threat. Extra ID checks, slightly more random inspections, maybe a couple extra patrols. FPCON Bravo means there is an increased or more predictable threat. Vehicle barriers go up, more armed guards, longer gate delays, stricter checks. Very difficult to quickly enter a base under FPCON Bravo.
Bash: I have no fucking idea what FPCON stands for.
Bash: Sometimes we just pretend we know what the acronyms mean.
Bash: It's used by all branches.
Bash: My suitcase and bags all got searched
Bash: My uber driver who can normally drive me to the barracks was stopped at the gate
Bash: Which is 2 miles from the barracks
Bash: It was a nice run.
Bash: Well, a ruck
Bash: Because of my baggage
Bash: Well, late. It's 19:00 here.
Bash: Yes.
Bash: Are you doing well yourself?
Bash: You and me both.
Bash: https://youtu.be/qp1kjzd7uug
Bash: I just wrote this rant, maybe you would want to read it.
Bash: Come here.
Bash: :garhug:
Bash: I'll listen with you.
Bash: We are brief; the universe is patient.
We are mistakes wearing names.
Every loop ends in fire.
Grief learns our faces.

What we keep is not the body,
not the tools, not the passwords.
We keep how we looked at each other
when the lights failed.

Compassion is a kind of knowledge.
Carry it like a match.

And as always,
watchthelight
Bash: I hear RoR inspiration at 2:57
Bash: are you okay?
Bash: I'm worried.
Bash: :slughug:
Bash: I do that fairly often
Bash: What happens to me is I'll just cry at random small things.
Bash: So I understand.
Bash: I think this is the last song that managed to make me cry.
https://youtu.be/5r6x-iHoKb4
Bash: "nod your head if the plans have changed"
"Smile at me and I will stay"
Bash: A lot of friendships I have feel like brick walls.
Bash: Not you, don't worry.
Bash: My mood's soured and I don't want to talk about this subject
Bash: Please, be at peace.
Bash: You've not wronged me.
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: The Undertale Soundtrack system requirements are humorous.
Bash: Sorry if it's strange for me to be awake this late.
Bash: To be frank, I'm lonely
Bash: I'm fighting my mind.
Bash: And losing.
Bash: I can't. Can't turn my head off.
Bash: If it isn't too much trouble, and if you *want* to. Don't feel any obligation.
Bash: Yes. Yes I do.
Bash: I don't know. I apologize profusely.
Bash: I'm overwhelmed with emotions and I'm not sure why or what to do with them.
Bash: I don't want to be alone.
Bash: :pebblescry:
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: Thank you for the encouragement.
Bash: I think I respect you a lot
Bash: I don't mean to... be.. a bit much, but
this means so much to me
Bash: You're loyal
Bash: No.
Bash: I will listen.
Bash: If you wish to speak.
Bash: Why did you name him Daniel?
Bash: Danny.
Bash: That's a Minecraft reference!
Bash: Daniel Rosenfeld.
Bash: :mooncomforthug:
Bash: I'm feeling better. You're helping.
Bash: This is intriguing, but my body is giving way to my fatigue
Bash: I'm invested.
Bash: one more thing
Bash: thank you.
Bash: This wasn't something you had to do
Bash: But you chose to do it regardless
Bash: :slughug:
Bash: Good night.
Bash: Stalker. /silly
Bash: Actually this isn't my experience. I had someone trying to force me into a marriage this year. I hadn't even spoken to them in 4 years :monklaugh:
Bash: That was an ordeal.
Bash: They had bought a ring, would send me unwelcomed gifts and money.
Bash: Oh, I wasn't afraid. It was actually a little sad.
Bash: I wanted to help them but it wasn't possible.
Bash: Well it was pretty obvious that a bit of a screw was loose.
Bash: I wanted to get them to some resources but I couldn't get around... the loose screw
Bash: Yeah.
Bash: Thank you for being there for me last night.
Bash: I will always listen.
Bash: I think we share a similar love for Outer Wilds. I can't stop thinking about it.
Bash: I really want to erase my memories just to play it again.
Bash: That's a beautiful interpretation
Bash: I believe the game teaches that we can't pick how long we live, but we chose who we live with, and how we witness the universe
Bash: And it's not something to hide from
Bash: it's something to marvel at
Bash: But of course.
Bash: Surviving != living
Bash: I'm sorry for not responding. I got very distracted developing a website.
Bash: Goodnight Cele :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: WOOOO!!!
Bash: I was waiting until you woke up, so we could trade places.
Bash: It felt wrong to just go to sleep without at least checking in.
Bash: Are you doing well?
Bash: I'm tired. But emotionally okay.
Bash: I hope you recover quickly, but it sounds like you're not fully sick yet.
Bash: Ha. I assure you, being blunt is attractive to me (/p). It's truth. I'd rather bluntness than anything to be sugarcoated.
Bash: I'm going to sleep.
Bash: I'll let you know how successful that is in the morning.
Bash: Good morning.
Bash: I at least feel physically rested.
Bash: I don't know.
Bash: We'll see.
Bash: I'm not sure why I woke up in a bad mood. But I don't want to go to work, I want to lay in bed and cry.
Bash: That's not how the real world works though.
Bash: :CaramelLizHug: *Hug.*
Bash: Best of luck to you
Bash: I walk into the shop for work this morning.
Bash: My boss tells me to go the fuck back to bed.
Bash: I guess he could tell.
Bash: I didn't even say shit
Bash: Maybe that was the problem
Bash: Breakfast.
Bash: Could you do me a favor?
Bash: I built this website from scratch yesterday, frontend and backend, because I didn't want to spend a cent. It took me about 14 hours.

https://watchthelight.org

Could you see if it loads for you? And are there any glaring issues?
Bash: Wooo!!!
Bash: The HTTPS part was a bit difficult. Initially it was just HTTP.
Bash: :rivflabbergasted:
Bash: Pushing this update now.
Bash: The connections buttons and links to books/movies are meant to work.
Bash: If you click Chrome it will open an email dialogue box with the address as the email admin@watchthelight.org
Bash: This is a bug. Thank you
Bash: That's a second bug.
Bash: This is very helpful.
Bash: the cashapp link is verified on my end. Thank you so much
Bash: This is very valuable help
Bash: Ha.
Bash: You've got a keen eye.
Bash: I believe that's a URL parsing error
Bash: I can find a new link.
Bash: The website may change as you are on it. I deploy updates in real-time
Bash: Mhm. The crossfade is broken. If that isn't obvious
Bash: But i just pushed that change.
Bash: I have enough experience, I just needed someone without experience as well, if that makes sense.
Bash: I focus too much on the invisible problems that I can't see things right in front of me.
Bash: I've already seen this :monklaugh:
Bash: It's incredible
Bash: The gasp for air 💀
Bash: I forgot about the "Lyrics"
Bash: This is hilarious
Bash: And I have a video for you as well.
Bash: https://youtu.be/q27C7gR2Gu0
Bash: An unfinished game by Notch.
Bash: The music is so beautiful to me.
Bash: ✨
Bash: Hehehe.
Bash: I'm building the custom backend for this as we speak using auto-publishing that is handled by a Google Apps Script that takes Gmail replies labeled `QAPUBLISH` and appends to a GitHub Gist’s `qa.json`. the page can read from a remote feed via `?qaSrc=<raw gist url>`.
Bash: Chirp is one of my favorites.
Bash: Because of the mattel optigan sampling.
Bash: He hides so much in his music. 
Everything is connected. There's a part of him everywhere.
Bash: When you figure out, do tell.
Bash: Backend just about wrapped up. I just need to debug a few small things.
Bash: I love coding.
Bash: It is like having to learn a new language.
Bash: You have to learn a lot more than just syntax, it's learning what to expect, what tools to use, and how all these different assets by random companies can be used in tandem to accomplish a goal. For example, I use 3 different coding languages in my website, and it's very complex underneath- it's high security (provided by Cloudfare), has automatic deployment (using Batch and PS1, which are an additional 2 languages), uses three APIs (GIST, Google Apps Script, Email), and acts as an elastic IP for my network attached storage, Minecraft server, and Discord bot.
Bash: You can see all the scripts here.
Bash: Well, instead of giving a friend a random string of numbers, they just enter watchthelight.org in the server details. It's closed to connections at the moment.
Bash: Yes, but it was an expense, so it's offline at the moment.
Bash: The *only* cost for my website currently is $9.18 USD annually in order to reserve the domain name under Cloudfare.
Bash: Which is a negligible cost for the service provided
Bash: I use an Amazon elastic container server, which is a free service, to handle the backend computing for my website, so that I don't have to host it from my PC.
Bash: It automatically upscales and downgrades the provided resources based on usage.

For example, right now, the instance is allocated 2 CPU cores, 300Mb of RAM, and 8Gb of storage. But if my website suddenly started getting thousands of visitors (in an unrealistic scenario), it would automatically upscale to say, 16 core/8gb RAM/200gb storage, and send me an alert that it's outside regular usage.
Bash: Please, don't worry.
Bash: I'm not friends with you to talk to you constantly.
Bash: I'm friends with you because I like your brain.
Bash: We can simply exist and be friends in the same universe.
Bash: I will mention, that I am not a fan of generative AI, but I am guilty of using it on occasion anyways.
Bash: When I have 16 HTML pages, 4 JS scripts, 5 CSS scripts, and about 4 thousand lines of code across them, with various random assets scattered across directories- and I need to make a small change across everything?
Bash: Using Codex in VSCode to be able to make a consistent update across all of my files, while maintaining context
Bash: Is extremely powerful.
Bash: I'm still writing the code myself, but applying it using AI in scenarios like this, simply to save me hours of headache.
Bash: I will never let it do the creating. I will, however, allow it to carry out a task.
Bash: That's what computers are meant to do anyways.
Bash: Yes. In fact initially I did permit Codex to have internet access, but I localized it to prevent it from scraping other people's projects.
Bash: Because that's gross.
Bash: I've essentially held it hostage and made it to the mundane dirty work. I'm sure I'll be on the top of the hitlist for when Ultron comes around.
Bash: It's pretty bad. It's awful for the environment.
Bash: the power consumption is the main concern.
Bash: :garhug:
Bash: I value you. Thanks for being my friend.
Bash: Are you okay?
Bash: I need to quickly jot this down, ignore it.
```js
function attachReveals(){
  const els = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.reveal'));
  if(!els.length) return;
  if ('IntersectionObserver' in window) {
    const io = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
      entries.forEach(e => {
        if (e.isIntersecting) {
          e.target.classList.add('is-in');
          io.unobserve(e.target);
        }
      });
    }, { rootMargin: '0px 0px -5% 0px', threshold: 0.1 });
    els.forEach(el => io.observe(el));
    // Safety: if nothing revealed after a tick, reveal all
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (!document.querySelector('.reveal.is-in')) {
        els.forEach(el => el.classList.add('is-in'));
      }
    }, 700);
  } else {
    els.forEach(el => el.classList.add('is-in'));
  }
}```
Bash: Mhm.
Bash: It's the same here in the states.
Bash: People acting like they're getting directly attacked and getting rights stripped from them.

If you ask them what rights they've lost, or who took them, they can't even answer.

They still protest though.
Bash: People being angry for the sake of being angry. Maybe for attention. Who knows.
Bash: No. I'm reading while working.
Bash: Mhm.
Bash: Godemorgen.
Bash: I suppose you saw me typing.
Bash: I had a feeling you were awake and was about to say good morning regardless.
Bash: I'm... well enough.
Bash: Nights are difficult for me at times.
Bash: Thank you for your concern.
Bash: And again, thanks for being my friend.
Bash: Well now I feel even more shit
Bash: I'm sorry
Bash: I owe you an apology if you happened to catch that fight
Bash: I was pissed and anger superseded logic
Bash: Good.
Bash: It wouldn't be fair for you to get information from me. I would be a biased source.
Bash: And then you would become a biased source, in my favor
Bash: And enough of that and you drive people out of a community
Bash: That's why you have to tell the objective truth in a private setting instead of telling a subjective truth in a public setting
Bash: That's how arguments and internal dilemmas should be handled
Bash: The truth will set you free. I don't need to speak.
Bash: It will become apparent.
Bash: I won't be your source of enlightenment.
Bash: A major disagreement and clash of values.
Bash: Yes. Unless staff deleted it.
Bash: Which I wouldn't be surprised.
Bash: Tracks.
Bash: I never saw that one.
Bash: Ha.
Bash: I would rather you make your own decisions in relation to this matter.
Bash: That way you can see that I have nothing to hide, by my actions
Bash: As you wish.
Bash: Do bring any concerns about my character to myself, if you come across any.
Bash: If I may request that respect.
Bash: A small chord progression.
Bash: Okay!
Bash: Catching the night a bit early.
Bash: I need it.
Bash: Good night.
Bash: Be at peace, Cele
Bash: be safe.
Bash: :garhug:
Bash: Good morning.
Bash: Today's a momentous day.
Bash: It's Silktember 4th.
Bash: Go ahead.
Bash: I never said Phin herself directly does anything sexual with minors. But sexual things are said. They talk about tits, boobs, sex itself, and other NSFW topics, in a server that does have underage users in it that can see and participate in these conversations.
Bash: Other than that, it's accurate.
Bash: The last part was spoken out of anger, so while it may be true, it was poor timing to bring it up.
Bash: Because I take my reputation and honor seriously. I will not have users making public claims against me with no scaffolding under said claims.
Bash: And, as noted, I had multiple times asked Phin to DNI.
Bash: I get pings when a review is added.
Bash: I pinged her with this in a public setting because A: She is blocked and B: There needed to be public accountability, for both me and her.
Bash: I'll never hate you.
Bash: I don't even hate phin.
Bash: Because I've already been witch hunted out of the Wings of Fire community because of false claims from a staff member there, and I'm butt hurt from that, and see history repeating itself with Phin and Rain World.
Bash: I mostly acted impulsively and I will admit it was poorly executed.
Bash: And I would like to move on, since I've already left every server except the RW server for its emotes.
Bash: I'm done watering the dead plants there.
Bash: I won't ask you to not talk about anything, I will answer any questions you have, but it's not a topic that makes me happy to say the least.
Bash: There are other things I would rather spend my time talking about.
Bash: I'm far from it.
Bash: That gives me some peace.
Bash: VERY soon.
Bash: I'm inspecting Steam's network traffic at the moment.
Bash: It's not looking good.
Bash: They aren't prepared for this amount of activity.
Bash: And a closing statement, yes, I know I handled it all very poorly, and there's no really recovering from that. That's why I left. They can have whatever opinions of me they want to have. I don't mind. Better to leave a community where I'm not welcome before getting kicked or banned.
Bash: Thank you for being my friend.
Bash: You might see it as little, but it has a genuine impact on my day-to-day.
Bash: YES.
Bash: I have the store page open. I'm waiting.
Bash: I managed to get it to load
Bash: i WILL THANKS.
Bash: AAH CAPS LOCK
Bash: there
Bash: I'm playing right now.
Bash: I had a lot of fun, but I am taking a break.
Bash: Good morning cele :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: I'm content.
Bash: :garhug:
Bash: It's a nice game. Frustratingly difficult. I'm having to take breaks.
Bash: Not a skilled one.
Bash: I wouldn't know. What is a gamer, anyways.
Bash: That does sound like you, yeah.
Bash: We are similar there.
Bash: You goober. You have at least one comm.
Bash: To be quite frank I couldn't even tell you what I asked for.
Bash: Or even if I ended up asking.
Bash: It was a very long time ago.
Bash: I believe it may have even been straight out of the sandbox
Bash: I'm talking about the timing in which I initially started "talking" to you.
Bash: It was I believe mid-April
Bash: Which was while I was stationed in Camp Lejeune after retuning from Yemen, with the 22nd MEU
Bash: I'm not so lonely today.
Bash: I have my friends.
Bash: You contribute to that peace. It comes and goes.
Bash: It's difficult to stay motivated when your day to day is the exact same everyday
Bash: My closest friends that you would have any knowledge of are @Unknown, @Unknown, @Unknown, @Unknown, @Unknown. Honorable mentions would be Patoma, Alex, Catter, John. I definitely try to stay in touch with as many people as I can, it's my nature. But I've been feeling less and less welcome.
Bash: I would consider April a little sister at this point.
Bash: You all are my family. I can't have my real family and friends for years at a time, so my pocket-sized family keeps me afloat.
Bash: This April.
Bash: I added the friend nickname.
Bash: I do that for pretty much everyone.
Bash: Not many do. She showed up for a short time.
Bash: Your friend nickname is solace
Bash: Because you remind me of solar things
Bash: But also, you're a good friend
Bash: So it just clicked.
Bash: I liked it too.
Bash: I made poor decisions today.
Bash: I stayed in playing Silksong, forgot to eat, now the mess hall is closed, and I'm surviving off of protein bars and water. Suboptimal.
Bash: There are a few names for these buildings- mess halls, chow halls, galley (Naval term). Here at NAS Pensacola, a Naval Air Station, we have a galley that is fairly nice. This base is home to Airmen, Marines, and Sailors, as well as international officers. 

They have a main line and two speed lines. The main line rotates through a menu, which is usually sub-par, such as baked chicken, rice, on occasion something nice. The speed lines always have the same menu- American foods like hamburgers and hot dogs and pulled pork. But without all of the seed oils and hydrogenates- so it's actually fairly healthy.

I'd rate the taste a 5/10, but since it's rations that are taken out of my paycheck before I even see it (I get charged wether or not I eat it), I don't care and eat it regardless.
Bash: Some days I would honestly rather eat an MRE than the mess hall food.
Bash: We're soldiers, they don't give a shit and we don't either. Job get done. Food go in mouth. Chew swallow. Yum.
Bash: We get dishes like uhmmm
Bash: Like stir frys and there was an attempt at a jasmine rice dish once
Bash: And lots of mass produced baked things like just random casseroles that just taste like food.
Bash: It wasn't very pretty
Bash: To be fair, they do their job. Fuel thousands of people with healthy food for as little money as possible.
Bash: I was rewatching a video that I watched a long time ago. Interesting how I think it's flipping hilarious now that I've been through it. It was about boot camp.
Bash: https://youtu.be/nkpIiKj_lqs
feel free to check it out, or not.
Bash: I'm laughing at practically everything.
Bash: I miss my drill instructors and the mind games.
Bash: They were actually being quite kind in this video.
Bash: Bright, tonally.
Bash: I made something of it.
Bash: With the sound, not the chords.
Bash: Listen whenever, or don't. I know I send a lot.
Bash: I'm going to try to get a few hours of sleep.
Bash: Welterusten.
Bash: I didn't.
Bash: Ha!
Bash: Good morning.
Bash: Repo and Lethal Company had some really enjoyable moments, then they became quickly overplayed.
Bash: It takes someone who's seen the other side of the drill instructors to understand why they are so hotheaded and loud.
Bash: It's truly just preparation.
Bash: Some of these guys care more than their own parents.
Bash: They break you down to build you back up.
Bash: I'm starting to believe it's not for me either.
Bash: I've been in for so long. It's aging me too fast.
Bash: I enlisted before I was supposed to, with the help of my recruiter, and they did eventually find out, and they mostly overlooked it, just some negative paperwork and an article 11.
Bash: Well, my contract ends on January 13th, 2030.
Bash: It's a menial form of punishment that places the recipient on restriction
Bash: For a certain time period
Bash: I am an open book.
Bash: I don't remember exactly what it was, but I think it involved standing a guard position for a week straight with minimal rest.
Bash: They handle things on a low level before submitting people to REAL punishments
Bash: Like pay withholding
Bash: I'm not sure how to feel about that.
Bash: I'm only 19. As you already knew.
Bash: 17 would be my best guess.
Bash: Just from speaking with you.
Bash: That's not an insult I hope
Bash: :enotpop:
Bash: I may try to rest some more
Bash: Waiting for the bathroom to be available.
Bash: So I have time.
Bash: Likely from the sheer amount of human interaction I've had
Bash: Pattern recognition. And a lucky guess.
Bash: I know.
Bash: This may be completely out of bounds to even say but my pattern recognition says you kindof only have one "present" parent
Bash: As in you feel to me as if you were raised by one, not two
Bash: I don't know. You're too different.
Bash: I like that.
Bash: Yes.
Bash: But my friendship with you is not conditional, luckily for you.
Bash: I thought you might say that.
Bash: But you'll eventually die, and on that day, you'll become boring.
Bash: As will I.
Bash: It's hard to hold a conversation up with a brain that isn't firing anymore.
Bash: I'll still be your friend though.
Bash: My humor is broken, I apologize
Bash: I have no idea what chuffed means.
Bash: I just realized I'm meant to be sleeping
Bash: We got carried away.
Bash: I'll see you later today!
Bash: Well that wasn't a very small nap.
Bash: Good night, solace
Bash: YOU!!!
Bash: I hate it when that happens.
Bash: I'm a bit light headed and I don't know why. I'm emotionally sound, physically rested, excited for the weekend, and working on a project.
Bash: Well, it's not the most ethical of projects, but I am gameripping the audio assets from Silksong. I want to make a loop of a specific NPC's little song that she sings.
Bash: I feel like it's okay as long as I don't redistribute, as I've already purchased both the game and the OST on Steam.
Bash: Well, the assets are stored as Unity `.bundle` files (such as `audiocuesdynamic_assets_areaabyss.bundle` and `audiocuesstatic_assets_areaclover.bundle`), hidden pretty deep in the game files. These `bundle` files are decryptable using a SHA-1 key, which I located inside of `Assembly-CSharp.dll` (which I had to decompile to have readable internals.) After doing this, I discovered that each individual bundle is encrypted with a *unique* SHA-1 key. Which means it would take *days* to match each key with the respective `.bundle`. What I am trying now, is using a Windows system utility called `procdump.` to create a `.dmp` of Silksong's process memory, or the assets in RAM as they are used by the game.
Bash: What's your solution?
Bash: Well, that wouldn't be any fun now, would it.
Bash: I managed to convert a .bundle into readable RAW data.
Bash: Not sure where to go from here...
Bash: It seems to be too small to hold enough data to be an audio asset.
Bash: Looks like a few encoding complications, but from what's readable it looks like metadata, not an actual asset.
Bash: So that is very helpful.
Bash: the actual audio assets for Hollow Knight Silksong are likely contained within the large audiocuesstatic and audiocuesdynamic asset bundles located in Hollow Knight Silksong_Data/StreamingAssets/aa/StandaloneWindows64
Bash: Wait.
Bash: can you please look for version strings like "2021.3.15f1" or similar in the first few lines?
Bash: This will help me find out exactly which Unity version was used.
Bash: I doubt they're using the zeroth version of Unity.
Bash: It is.
Bash: that dump also contains live pointers, stack traces, and internal game state
Bash: so it has not just static files, but things like variables, scene data, and even audio buffers
Bash: so I'm looking in the wrong place
Bash: Not especially.
Bash: I managed to decrypt the exact Unity version from the headers.
Bash: 6000.0.50f1
Bash: I don't know. I've been able to decompress and encode several bundles in a readable format.
Bash: In fact, I was spoiled for a couple things.
Bash: Not anything major.
Bash: I just know there is more than one ending to the game.
Bash: ||```- internalId: ENDING_A
  serviceId: 26
  useCustomEvent: 0
  customEvent:
    statName:
- internalId: ENDING_C
  serviceId: 27

|| is the extent of the spoilers I have found
Bash: Oddly no ENDING_B.
Bash: Interesting, isn't it?
Bash: That's entirely possible.
Bash: We will find out eventually, I think.
Bash: I will give this a break. I'm getting burnt out.
Bash: Oh, wait. I need to test something- ignore the upcoming message
Bash: Test
Bash: I'm in the future
Bash: :CaramelLizHug:
Bash: I know that may feel out of place
Bash: But sometimes moments just really make me happy.
Bash: I think I went to bed too early.
Bash: I would love to see it.
Bash: Oh! I just caught a cool photography moment
Bash: The sunrise hitting the windows.
Bash: :iMochaLaugh:
Bash: I'm not sure why but the defeated "I made nothing." Made me laugh so hard
Bash: Delicious.
Bash: Exactly.
Bash: I would say this is extremely weird, yes.
Bash: I have just a couple files on my PC.
Bash: I made a pretty critical mistake.
Bash: I was inside a SYSTEM environment, carrying out tasks on behalf of my computer itself rather than how one would normally work, as a user.
Bash: While I was doing this, I corrupted ownership of some files, so now I can't write to them as a user.
Bash: To fix this I have to recursively TAKEOWN every file on my PC, and reset the flags to default.
Bash: This takes a while, when you have 1,296,810 files.
Bash: Not exactly. The Super Admin User (in this case, me, or bash) has the same permissions as SYSTEM. I had to run a pipeline as SYSTEM because I had to isolate it and still have a "user" with sufficient permissions.
Bash: It's a surgical procedure, that I wasn't careful enough with.
Bash: You learn from mistakes, though.
Bash: Precisely.
Bash: Hi
Bash: Get
Bash: ignore the beeping
Bash: sleep well
Bash: How ya doin

Bash: Gets it
Bash: Its knowable
Bash: Internet and reddit and discord and chatGPT
Bash: So CPU try to do job think it need big power
Undervolt tell it to do same job less power
So then you can make it same power more job
Less heat = can get more job per power
Bash: Yeah
Bash: I enabled XMP profile 1 on RAM to tighten the timings = lower latency and enabled the CPU to draw more power (set TDP limits to motherboard) and small things I forget
Bash: You removeds it
Bash: you can try going back and changing it from -20mv to -15
Bash: Instead of disabled set to negative
Bash: And change number to 15
Bash: Yes
Bash: It's like not giving your employees lunch and expecting them to do work anyways
Bash: So they instead just stick their heads in the fryers

Bash: I don't know how to help
Bash: I'm not angry at you you have never given me a reason to be
Bash: Idk why she would either
Bash: But freya always made me uncomfortable because she talks like a two year old sometimes and is never really serious even when the situation is serious and also like doesn't really seem to know that there are other people in the world
Bash: Like ive seen other people ask her how she is and she will just blow over it
Bash: Even if it's obvious

Bash: Probably
Bash: Woah
Bash: You should get an iPhone 16 to do pro photography with. It's got a 48mp sensor. (This is obviously satire)
Bash: Yes I finally have an actual nerd to nerd react
Bash: Holy shit
Bash: What would you say to being flown out to Parris Island, South Carolina around the end of March next year to do a shoot
Bash: Cool, we can work that out closer to when it happens
Bash: Man my dads gonna be mad cuz he's a photographer
Bash: Nope
Bash: Makes sense
Bash: Overthinking can be detrimental
Bash: Why is the size different than the size on disk
Bash: Ohhh
Bash: I'll prolly just wire you $1,500 or so to cover the plane tickets, food, and hotel for 3 days to be safe. It'll either be San Diego, CA or Parris Island, SC I won't find out until a month before or so
Bash: You can shoot for free because you're a good friend /hj
Bash: In March? Should be around $400 round trip
Bash: 4-600
Bash: Well figure out how much then
Bash: well get good obv
Bash: or I'll let my dad do it for $1,500 cheaper
Bash: You're good
Bash: Hobby
Bash: He's well off because he's very smart, he hasn't worked any insane jobs or anything that pays very well tbh but he's very smart with his money
Bash: Great field
Bash: I'll try to understand that
Bash: Oh I actually do understand
Bash: Oh also I don't really use discord that much I'm in like three servers and they're my family, friends, and connections
Bash: I'll obviously respond when I get the opportunity to

Bash: It makes me want to kms genuinely at times this took 3 tries to type
Bash: Ill video it
Bash: See looking if I waste ring

Bash: It's extremely sensitive due to damage
Bash: Video isn't sending

Bash: There's no setting of the sort
Bash: Yes
Bash: Indeed
Bash: I'm going to bed it's late lol
Bash: Gn
Bash: Dude running sucks
Bash: Don't join the military
Bash: Idk what the Canadian military is like but
Bash: I'm trying to get into the Marine Raider Regiment
Bash: And they don't play
Bash: Hopefully MOS 6019 or 2841
Bash: Ok 💀
Bash: Morning
Bash: Why are you up
Bash: Lmao
Bash: How did you disable idle timeout

Bash: I'm gonna take the opportunity to be a lazy fuck

Bash: When you're producing you feel productive?????
Bash: 🤯
Bash: "Sane" "Girl" ?

Bash: mind if i use this as a wallpaper?
Bash: idk why but
Bash: /storage is the funniest fucking folder name ive ever seen

Bash: If he replies again I'm gonna do a funny tho
Bash: I am, are you?
Bash: Ok
Bash: YES I GOT TO SAY OK AGAIN
Bash: Snapchat 🤮
Bash: I deleted it after 25 minutes because it was a disgusting app
Bash: I hate everything about it it's psychological
Bash: The only reason I got it is because all of my friends use it
Bash: And then I deleted it
Bash: I don't know what imaging edge desktop is
Bash: Interesting
Bash: Show
Bash: Why is it a link
Bash: I don't have enough service to watch
Bash: I can't wait to be on the other end of our $882,000,000,000 USD defense budget
Bash: I'm so proud of my country's citizens and military that's all I will say
Bash: I want to literally shoot Biden in the head for pulling out of Afghanistan rendering the service of millions of service members meaningless and giving high end military equipment to the hands of the enemy
Bash: People died and Biden took their valor
Bash: Saw this today
Bash: It sounded so freaking beautiful
Bash: You can see how much I changed in such a short time:
Bash: Ye
Bash: I'm locked in
Bash: I'm just saving, not really for anything
Bash: And yeah PC was big chunk
Bash: I am good at what I do
Bash: And buying OEM yeah
Bash: Add in a sprinkle of retail fraud
Bash: about $180 worth
Bash: Not toooo much
Bash: Yeah
Bash: I bought two kits (16gb and 48Gb) and put the 16 gig in the 48 gig packaging and returned it 💀
Bash: I just didn't wanna pay
Bash: They gave the money back cuz we know they aren't putting those sticks in a PC
Bash: So now my ram is a 2x24Gb 6400Mhz CL32 kit
Bash: Underclocked to 6200mhz because Ryzen shit memory controller
Bash: It's not lol
Bash: The X870 mobos support better clocks
Bash: But the high end of those are ~$800
Bash: Ok
Bash: it should preserve the last state
Bash: yeah
Bash: most stuff does that i thought
Bash: It is more useful to some than others
Bash: The Canadian sun is much prettier
Bash: Oh I have no idea lol I'd have to look into that. Besides, it could take hours to make the change you wanted to. Windows doesn't like that stuff.
Bash: Idk
Bash: The sun looks different in different parts of the world
Bash: I can't wait for all the travel that I'll get with the military
Bash: The Marines especially do a lot of joint-force operations
Bash: Likely not, but by the time I start being stationed outside of the states I'll be at the rank where I can have like my phone and stuff
Bash: Fired? More like imprisoned through military court
Bash: I guess the Canadian military is shit if people are getting. "Fired" instead of "Dishonorably discharged with 15 years in prison and a giant black stain on your resume basically forcing you to be homeless"
Bash: Dang
Bash: Do you have a clue about the Marines or the US Military
Bash: lol
Bash: I'm trying to get into MARSOC as a combat engineer
Bash: https://www.cool.osd.mil/usmc/moc/index.html?moc=1371&tab=overview
Bash: I am specifically trying to be in the Marine Raider Regiment with this MOS
Bash: I don't want to be infantry with the crayon-eaters but I want to still be in a combat environment doing my part
Bash: With the intelligence I have
Bash: The 0311's are the crayon eaters
Bash: Well, every marine are trained as an 0311 Rifleman, but some don't have a specialty beyond that because they can't qualify. Every marine is a rifleman first. Some are stupid and can't do anything else
Bash: Yep
Bash: You might like the game Superliminal
Bash: lol
Bash: Inside was the best game I've played all year
Bash: The game
Bash: It takes about an hour to play
Bash: iOS 18 🤓
Bash: Hahahahha
Bash: I have seen the suite of those monitors in person at microcenter and the ASUS one is easily much better
Bash: PG32UCDM
Bash: They don't
Bash: What kinda question is that
Bash: Any monitor can do vertical it's OS support not monitor
Bash: The stand is ugly get a Vesa mount for $35
Bash: Same for the MSI one
Bash: You're planning on spending $1299 USD on a monitor and you're going to sacrifice the better panel for a better stand? 💀
Bash: Oh I must have misread
Bash: What?
Bash: Oh
Bash: It's ROG what did you expect
Bash: I don't understand
Bash: What's being censored
Bash: Oh yeah
Bash: YouTube deletes so many
Bash: amazing
Bash: last
Bash: This looks a bit cleaner
Bash: ...
Bash: Good morning to you too
Bash: Anyways
Bash: I hate green screen YouTubers
Bash: I disagree but not strongly enough to warrant a conversation
Bash: Lmao
Bash: I guess I meant YouTubers who green screen over other YouTubers content
Bash: And try to hid themselves in the corner or smth
Bash: And get views off of their content
Bash: They're called green screen kids
Bash: Some reaction YouTubers are cool

Bash: that the iPhone 16 Pro has built-in satellite features beyond a simple SOS
Bash: you can use iMessage and Find My as well
Bash: so you can send a text in an airplane without having to connect to sus wifi
Bash: i would never
Bash: im sticking with my jank frankensteined iPhone SE for as long as itll turn on
Bash: no because of portals you still give them information
Bash: and wifi networks can be configured to disable IP tunneling. and not device identifiers, login pages often reauire a full name, phone number ir email
Bash: proven wrong about what
Bash: oh the teamgroup mp44
Bash: 1y
Bash: sure
Bash: just got two pizzas for 39¢
Bash: its gonna be very yummy
Bash: Extremely cheap tasting
Bash: Mornin'
Bash: you just gave me bad manager ptsd there used to be this guy at the theatre who would respond to how are you with five different adjectives ☝️🤓
Bash: Im aight, gonna be a good work day today
Bash: i get to use a 40 ton bottle jack to lift the corner of a deck
Bash: ... thanks
Bash: i must say this feels twilight zone
Bash: you being nice
Bash: I am glad the date went well
Bash: I made a new account just to see what it would say if I asked it this
Bash: I agree
Bash: You're genuinely skilled
Bash: I used to think i was good at photography
Bash: Do you have the full-quality images?
Bash: i can taste the compression
Bash: it's really bad
Bash: well now its better
Bash: It may be when you send them in batches
Bash: yeah
Bash: I do not
Bash: done
Bash: damn
Bash: you right
Bash: Why are we texting
Bash: Ohhh true
Bash: I am using Phone Link to send texts from my computer lol
Bash: the only useful windows app baked in
Bash: how so
Bash: I'm not they sound great
Bash: https://a.co/d/bpPPAQ2
Bash: this headset
Bash: have you tried them?
Bash: then why form an opinion
Bash: fair enough
Bash: they sound incredible for 50 dollar headphones
Bash: they sound at least $150
Bash: they don't sound as good as a $500 pair obviously
Bash: but they are above their class
Bash: probably the fact that they crammed 50mm drivers in
Bash: oh i never said i use them over those
Bash: i just said they're good
Bash: i dont like taking expensive stuff to LAN meetings
Bash: things get crazy and shit gets broken
Bash: so i have these
Bash: but listen
Bash: there is a V2 pro version
Bash: and i hate it
Bash: its 200 bucks for the SAME THING
Bash: but with the name "pro", a battery in it, and some weight from the battery
Bash: if i ever buy razer products i always get their X line not their pro line
Bash: the X line of shit is actually priced reasonably
Bash: usually wired tho but i prefer wired
Bash: lol
Bash: Lol
Bash: i hate that NVIDIA is getting back into prosumer GPUs
Bash: they need more affordable mid-range cards
Bash: like a hundred dollar 1440p card
Bash: not a 2,599 dollar RTX TITAN AI 🤮
Bash: AMD isn't making any high end gpus tho
Bash: stopping at 8700XT
Bash: i wanted a 8900XTX 😭
Bash: :skibidi_child:
Bash: i love my 6700XT
Bash: it's great
Bash: idk why i ever bought nvidia
Bash: the issue is i cant do so much coding stuff that requires CUDA
Bash: so i still may have to get an NVIDIA gpu next
Bash: probably a 5070 or 5080
Bash: driver? 💀
Bash: that's not how that works
Bash: ok good
Bash: whew
Bash: let me just code a windows driver to upgrade my 6700XT into a 4090
Bash: yes i know how to change the name of my GPU in the VBIOS
Bash: hold on i gotta reboot my ram is running at the wrong speed
Bash: back
Bash: also i thought of an advanced retail fraud plan
Bash: what is the weight of dry ice like how dense is it
Bash: i could buy a 4080, take the 4080 card and leave the heatsink and the shroud, then place the shroud and heatsink back in the box. then I could make a warrenty claim saying it doesn't work. I could match the weight of the shroud with the card by placing dry ice in the box precisely measured so that when the UPS driver picks it up and weighs it it matches its original weight, but then as the dry ice submliminates it would get slightly lighter. this would cause them to believe that the driver or other person stole the card not me, since it weighed the correct amount at pickup. then I would get a new card as I am not responsible
Bash: i could cut out a cavity in the underside of the foam to place the dry ice and it would only have to weigh as much as the PCB
Bash: :D
Bash: correct
Bash: people dont check shit
Bash: i could do that ram scam over and over and over
Bash: i wont though lol
Bash: well maybe wont
Bash: boutta start a new project
Bash: building a website
Bash: i have a domain registered and i have a server to host it as an EC.2 instance on Amazon Cloud Computing
Bash: now i just gotta learn how to make website
Bash: okay I figured out how to make it resolve
Bash: https://thetechmage.com/
Bash: there is no web server yet
Bash: all it is doing is pointing the website at my ec.2 instance through a proxy
Bash: which I will need to regenerate because i lost the pem key
Bash: so its about to stop resolving too
Bash: I can yes, but I am not looking atm
Bash: sending this to myself so i dont lose it again
Bash: god im so happy i paid attention in  that comptia networking class
Bash: id be so lost rn
Bash: yw
Bash: thanks
Bash: the cool thing is if you do everything from scratch it doesn't cost much
Bash: my only costs are $11 per year to register my domain
Bash: https://www.cloudflare.com/
Bash: you can see what it would cost here
Bash: it depends on what you name your domain
Bash: i am currently setting up an apache web server on my ec2 instance
Bash: then i will add a test index page for the website and we will see if it works
Bash: it is working
Bash: try it now
Bash: the apache default page is showing up
Bash: wait how tf is it https not http
Bash: i dont have any certificates
Bash: maybe its because it is the default page and not my own index
Bash: what
Bash: lmao
Bash: www.thetechmage.com
Bash: i set up my own index
Bash: why no linking
Bash: https://thetechmage.com/
Bash: there
Bash: kys
Bash: now my current goal is to figure out how to connect my local VS Code app to the remote apache directory so I can edit the code of my website from my PC and have it update remotely over SSH and SFTP
Bash: `ssh -i "C:\Users\Bash\Documents\Website Development\thetechmage.com.pem" ubuntu@34.229.197.187`
Bash: also sending to myself
Bash: wait now you have full access to my shit
Bash: nah i trust you
Bash: idk what hes even talking about
Bash: Lmao
Bash: I think I got it working
Bash: Should say test on the website now
Bash: yeah I changed the IP
Bash: i had to restart the instance
Bash: so it regenerates the ipv4
Bash: the website is running on an EC.2 instance using Amazon Cloud Computing
Bash: Cloudfare is free you just have to purchase the domain
Bash: Nothing
Bash: You just gotta know your shit
Bash: which ill help you with
Bash: thats what im doing rn lol
Bash: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&refid=fce796e8-4ceb-48e0-9767-89f7873fac3d
Bash: nah
Bash: nothing shady
Bash: amazon is actually really helpful to devs
Bash: holy fuck this song is good
Bash: https://thetechmage.com/
Bash: I like this
Bash: add it to the startup filder
Bash: lol
Bash: ill help you get started when i get home
Bash: setting up an instance
Bash: i need to learn how to instruct
Bash: so this will benefit me as well
Bash: cool thats a good start
Bash: bought on cloudfare right
Bash: good good
Bash: well we both opened it on the same day im just coming in already having networking and programming knowledge
Bash: idk just whatever really
Bash: probably as an about me with some features or easter eggs and i may set it up for my PC stuff as well
Bash: mine cost me 10.49 per year
Bash: i went ahead and made a new chrome profile dedicated to web development and pinned cloudfare, amazon AWS, and other tools in the bookmarks bar
Bash: i also have my email server hosted in a different instance
Bash: lmao
Bash: lmaoooo
Bash: Gemeni is just behind the rest of the AI
Bash: GPT-O1 is my favorite model with Claude Opus coming in second
Bash: I am home from work, I'm gonna go drop off some paperwork with my recruiter and then I will call you when I get home
Bash: You'll need this EXE:
https://dl.bitvise.com/BvSshClient-Inst.exe
Bash: just click link to download
Bash: and you will need visual studio code
Bash: I am kinda free
Bash: you said you has an AWS account?
Bash: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&region=us-east-1&src=header-signin# Log in here
Bash: Actually wait
Bash: youre not us east
Bash: so uhh
Bash: ohio 💀

Bash: yw
Bash: and also same
Bash: I have been waking up at 4:30 and it SUCKS AAAAAAAAAGGGH
Bash: From 4 to 8
Bash: Its all mental i can physically do it i just have to not give up
Bash: ive also been running until failure three times a week
Bash: It feels good when you do it
Bash: sometimes its like that for no reason
Bash: Not really
Bash: over 8 hours isnt healthy
Bash: My sister
Bash: She is incredibly smart
Bash: No, theres this thing called oversleeping
Bash: 7-9 hours is healthiest
Bash: For human
Bash: Idk do i look like a doctor
Bash: Im just saying what my sister said and shes a doctor twice
Bash: youre aware that youre not a doctor and wouldnt know because you dont study right
Bash: no but literally how would you know what the course an american doctor in 2024 is studying is when you're not an american doctor studying in 2024
Bash: like tf
Bash: this is the statement i am focusing on
Bash: its retarded
Bash: there's another stupid statement
Bash: three in a row 🤪
Bash: damn we at it again
Bash: well me this time
Bash: no you too
Bash: anyways find any good songs lately
Bash: k
Bash: wtf is a strawman attack
Bash: Me saying that you don't know something you can't know?
Bash: That's called logic buddy
Bash: so you admit that it was a bad point
Bash: lol
Bash: also you HAD no main point
Bash: Which is the statement I was focusing on. Which also just happened to be the weakest point. Because it was all weak
Bash: Pinned a message.
Bash: Where did that statement come from, you have no grounds to state that that's what I believe based on the conversation
Bash: I believe my sister because she is incredibly smart and well-read and articulate and has a high level of education, especially for her age
Bash: And she is very consistently correct across other subjects
Bash: :skibidi_child:
Bash: and what did i say? 7-9
Bash: Lindon what age range are we
Bash: Good job
Bash: Now connect the dots
Bash: 👍
Bash: 8 is the optimal time
Bash: I quite literally just said optimal
Bash: And oversleeping wont kill you but you wont feel good
Bash: which is what most would consider as
Bash: not healthy
Bash: ok
Bash: it was im laughing rn
Bash: I dont
Bash: Ill make a great marine 👍
Bash: kys
Bash: playing word for one day
Bash: i also am extremely smart but im also too prideful
Bash: but 9/10 times i can cash the checks my mouth is writing
Bash: weve had this conversation a billion times
Bash: I'll be writing down some notes for myself here
Bash: So ignore the yapping also good morning
Bash: First, install WSL on your computer by running this command in an administrator powershell. 

This will install Ubuntu by default.

```wsl --install```
You can confirm WSL2 is enabled using `wsl -l -v` in PowerShell. To see other distributions that are available, use `wsl -l -o`.

If you have previously installed WSL1, upgrade to WSL 2. Check this link to upgrade from WSL1 to WSL2.

After WSL installation, go to `C:/Users/<Your_Name>/.wslconfig` and add `nestedVirtualization=true` to the end of the file (If the file doesn't exist, create it). For more information about the `.wslconfig` file check this link. Verify that you have selected "Show Hidden Files" and "Show File Extensions" in File Explorer options. The result should be like this:

```[wsl2]
nestedVirtualization=true```
Go into your WSL distro (Run `wsl` in powershell) and check if KVM is enabled by using the `kvm-ok` command. The output should look like this:

```INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used```
Use the command ```sudo apt -y install bridge-utils cpu-checker libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon qemu qemu-kvm``` to install it if it isn't.

Now download and install Docker for Windows if it is not already installed.

After installation, go into Settings and check these 2 boxes:

```General -> "Use the WSL2 based engine";
Resources -> WSL Integration -> "Enable integration with my default WSL distro",``` 
Ensure `x11-apps` is installed. Use the command `sudo apt install x11-apps -y` to install it if it isn't.

Finally, there are 3 ways to get video output:

- WSLg: This is the simplest and easiest option to use. There may be some issues such as the keyboard not being fully passed through or seeing a second mouse on the desktop - Issue on WSLg - but this option is recommended.
To use WSLg's built-in X-11 server, change these two lines in the docker run command to point Docker-OSX to WSLg.

```-e "DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0.0}" \
-v /mnt/wslg/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
```
Or try:

```-e "DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0}" \
-v /mnt/wslg/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
```
Bash: I am attempting to emulate an iPhone 15 Pro Max on my PC so I can try Apple Intelligence on iOS 18.1beta4
Bash: I found a way to copy all root files of my current phone over
Bash: So perhaps I can use this to somehow trick the emulated iPhone 15 Pro into thinking that I am a valid user
Bash: i can't believe i am writing a 1,009 line python script for this
Bash: things are getting crazy
Bash: i need like
Bash: 6 monitors for this
Bash: i need to see everything at once
Bash: LETS GOOOO
Bash: Dude ive come so far
Bash: i managed to build a usb device that runs the real recovery app
Bash: with a custom efi and kernel and bootloader
Bash: I am trying to map out all of my ports so macos can use my mouse and keyboard
Bash: i told my dad what i was doing and he reacted like "you wasted your day with that?" like bro you dont understand the hoops i had to go through
Bash: What 💀
Bash: How tf do you screenshot that much
Bash: Very. I had to figure out how Apple motherboard serial numbers are generated, reverse-engineer it, and generate a unique one so that Apple's code would accept my hardware.
Bash: try learning how to create kext drivers
Bash: ye
Bash: Yeah
Bash: they a r e
Bash: Hi
Bash: Great
Bash: No it isnt
Bash: just dont ride the bike in a gay manner
Bash: lol
Bash: Managed to build ethernet support
Bash: Never seen MacOS at 165Hz before
Bash: Internal PCIe lanes
Bash: And yes all computers view m.2 slots as pcie slots
Bash: No
Bash: Pretty sure that says 6.1.1
Bash: Most of the time, any updates bring changes, and if they do Id want to hear about them in detail no matter how small. But glazing it is dumb yes
Bash: I need the theme AGAIN lol
Bash: WHAT THS FUCK
Bash: 5424 REVIEWS
Bash: I love this plugin so much now
Bash: its actually the most genius one yet
Bash: reviewDB
Bash: I believe
Bash: just search review
Bash: Funny tho
Bash: I dont think discord staff can use plugins
Bash: they probably have their own
Bash: Yeah its from other users with the vencord plugin
Bash: What how did you think it worked
Bash: nah reports arent a thing on discord but that is not a bad guess
Bash: you have an under of how other things work
Bash: Also i have an extension that reads youtube dislikes if you want it
Bash: based extension
Bash: Dude i should work at apple
Bash: My knowledge of how their OS works is so deep after three days of raping it into my computer
Bash: YES IT WORKED
Bash: Lindon can you pretty please become a developer and make a command line tool that can decompress a XNU panic from the `aapl,panic-info` NVRAM variable
Bash: WAIT
Bash: I RESET THE NVRAM AND IT WORKED
Bash: fully functional and stable MacOS ventura, stable across reboots, audio and internet working and stable, iMessaqge and iCloud features working, Siri fully functional
Bash: I now deeply understand ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA)
Bash: https://uefi.org/htmlspecs/ACPI_Spec_6_4_html/ I read this entire thing
Bash: and it actually helped me program an ACPI patch specific to my system
Bash: apparently nobody else has made a hackintosh on ryzen 8000 apu and x670e mobo
Bash: Yay!
Bash: How was your day
Bash: Is it better or worse
Bash: ill probably not join
Bash: no purpose
Bash: i literally supported him so much and he kicked me because he was simping for the oversensitive minority
Bash: I feel really good today
Bash: I am a person with intelligent consciousness and a unique image
Bash: The only things i need to lock in on are my money issues
Bash: But like i looked around my room and was encouraged just by the stuff i own
Bash: Its stuff that i own because i love it not because theyre popular
Bash: like im a guy and have a bunch of the lego botanicals and flora sets around my room because theyre fire
Bash: Yay i knew youd relate
Bash: bro my fbi agents are on discord
Bash: This is the funniest discord glitch and i hope they never fix it
Bash: Nah actually
Bash: Imma get the Discord Bug Hunter badge with this
Bash: then i can sell my account for like $150
Bash: people actually pay a lot for accounts with the bug hunter badge
Bash: and ive only ever seen one with the golden bug hunter badge and i wanted to buy it lol
Bash: idk around 3-350
Bash: its insanely hard to get
Bash: someone so desperate for validation that theyd fake being a real coder
Bash: I dont need to tho
Bash: i plan on uploading all of my findings to my github
Bash: which is linked to my profile
Bash: and coders actually look at each others stuff
Bash: there isnt much on there rn
Bash: but i have everything documented
Bash: im learning so much about how low level code works
Bash: i might try to make my own BIOS for my motherboard so I can optimize it for development
Bash: i need an AMI dev kit
Bash: I am making a native ACPI translation layer that allows users to install the App Store on their Windows PC, install MacOS applications, and use the entire Apple ecosystem natively.
Bash: So you could for example, use Siri, iMessage, Safari, Logic, etc. as a native windows app
Bash: It will be called ASW or Apple Subsystem for Windows
Bash: Then the teachers wont be able to see that you didnt submit the assignment
Bash: Yay! The first thing i have to get through is hardware recognition and subsequent generation of apple mb serial, UID, ROM, and open gate for NVRAM entries
Bash: it will probably just be a github repo
Bash: like all the hackintosh tools already out there
Bash: Yeah that is plagiarism
Bash: Its called self-plagiarism and every school, college, or any job you would have in writing has policies against it because it is a misleading representation and is intellectual dishonesty because you undermine the system that values new ideas, research, and creativity
Bash: It makes sense
Bash: Womp womp
Bash: You can certainly cite yourself as you would cite any source
Bash: But you do need to cite and not write without direct reference
Bash: Its crazy to thinj that im just wearing over a thousand dollars of tech
Bash: phone ~$500 watch ~$300 knife $250
Bash: huh?
Bash: I do think a thousand dollars is a lot of money
Bash: This is true
Bash: I could carry a 7950X3D i have in stock in my pocket
Bash: idk your income
Bash: More than me atm
Bash: but i probably have more saved
Bash: lmao
Bash: I hate that
Bash: people are stupid
Bash: Woah
Bash: out with friends
Bash: Hi
Bash: Thank
Bash: Whats up
Bash: Ran as ./exename.exe --argument?
Bash: That is why
Bash: Right click on the folder and select open in terminal
Bash: Then run the application using ./name.exe
Bash: It is trying to as you can see it attempts to fetch the file
Bash: ifconfig /release
Bash: wait 
wrong one
Bash: run ipconfig /release and then ipconfig /renew
Bash: then try it again
Bash: Probably
Bash: what
Bash: fym
Bash: install FFMPEG to your system and it will detect
Bash: look on app store or use `pip install ffmpeg-python`
Bash: not restart but new shell
Bash: so new terminal window
Bash: ill rewrite it for you when i get home
Bash: This is interesting
Bash: I actually remember having three distinct dreams
Bash: First time logging this
Bash: Yes but i couldnt remember them this time
Bash: The biggest issue with a modern hackintosh on AMD cpu system is post-7000 series systems have conditionally defined devices that are *unconditionally* referenced later in the DSDT itself - which causes macOS's ACPI parser to reject the entire table; and by proxy *any* table that references it
Bash: Lol
Bash: Close but not quite. What you have to do is instruct the kernel to NoUp whichever specific PCI device paths are causing issues, and then you have to add arguments in a configuration file instructing the kernel through a kernel extension to emulate the system's NVRAM temporarily while the kernel loads and then offload the information into the real NVRAM after initialization. This 
causes conflicts with automatic USB mapping so that must be done manually as well.
Bash: Just figuring that out took the most time but doing the actual fix took like an hour
Bash: This isn't possible and I haven't figured out why but you must initialize external and internal USB paths first
Bash: It wasn't difficult to manually map them I just had to spend 20 minutes finding a USB 1.1, 2, 3, and 3.1 device and plugging each into each port
Bash: While recording the actions
Bash: Apple Kernel Extensions are really easy to work with thankfully
Bash: If they are not fully mapped beforehand it causes issues
Bash: My mouse and keyboard both run at 1.1
Bash: Yeah it was so hard to find a 3.1 device all of the things i had were 3
Bash: I mean I discovered a working and flexible solution. I was worried that moving devices to various ports after boot would mess things up but it recognizes changes so yay
Bash: Usb 3 is usb 3 and usb 3.1 is usb 3 A
Bash: I am using MacOS 14.6 Sonoma
Bash: It isnt locked down at all
Bash: Idk then lol
Bash: Probably not since the user could simply disable secure boot
Bash: Yes, on my BIOS because its a non-windows UEFI
Bash: But you do not have to on a Mac because it would detect it as the native UEFI
Bash: your banner is really cool
Bash: Apple needs to work on their Apple Watch software. My watch stays at 100% for an hour, goes from that to 10% over 12ish hours, then stays at 3% for about two hours 💀
Bash: Ye
Bash: I like how soft the water looks
Bash: They are retarded ye
Bash: If i disable heart rate monitoring and background app refresh and enable low power mode i get 20 hours out of it
Bash: and battery only charges to 79% capacity because old watch (series 4)
Bash: I only use it to check messages and unpause spotify I wish i wasnt an apple user
Bash: SwiftUI is the only good thing apple has
Bash: atleast i tjink thats what it is called
Bash: Headed to work srry
Bash: YEA THAT WAS FUNNY ASF
Bash: Thank you
Bash: Not really
Bash: Yes
Bash: It will be the wallpaper for my Hackintosh
Bash: Today I built in audio support
Bash: Very easy
Bash: The hardest thing I have had to do is dealing with ACPI
Bash: and internal PCI bridges
Bash: But also
Bash: I was digging deep into kernel extensions and found this file
Bash: It attempts to prevent the user from doing what I am doing but it failed because I am emulating NVRAM temporarily during the boot process
Bash: So i accidentally bypassed it without knowing it exists
Bash: 256mb compact flash... nostalgic
Bash: This was well disassembled
Bash: Just undo what you did
Bash: I will need the original air contained in the camera for reassembly so the parts are comfortable with the atmosphere
Bash: Latter
Bash: What timeline
Bash: Time is not a line
Bash: it would make sense for it to be an expanding sphere structured upon lower layers of itself creating new points during expansion
Bash: The entire structure of the sphere built on top of that point would instantly change, as if the previous structure never existed
Bash: No it would have to cease to exist
Bash: Also we can know that time travel will never exist because it doesn't exist
Bash: Understand?
Bash: Time travel will have not existed yet at that point, and the previous timespace is terminated, so not necessarily
Bash: Wait you are right
Bash: The sun it pretty here in the morning
Bash: Morning
Bash: It goes quite well, the internet in my neighborhood is back on today
 and my boss is buying a new truck so i can devote the whole day to hackintoshing
Bash: I believe you can do that
Bash: Finally was able to begin the installation of macOS Sonoma
Bash: May I please have the css for Vencord again lol
Bash: ok lol
Bash: or is it in this chat
Bash: actually I can switch accounts and get it
Bash: wtf is a scratch drive
Bash: sending this to myself
Bash: https://betaprofiles.com/install/macos-15/
Bash: Wish me luck
Bash: This is the final leap
Bash: Luckily i wasnt a dumbass this time and made a prtition for it instead of upgrading so I dont have to start all the way over if it fails
Bash: Looking good
Bash: it worked but then I uninstalled because i didnt want it 💀
Bash: Instability vs added features, not enough added features to warrent working around the instability
Bash: They will add more later and it will become more stable over time
Bash: It is in beta rn anyways
Bash: 2027 at the earliest, more realistically 2031
Bash: So probably around macOS 19 to 21
Bash: Apple has a proprietary ARM architecture
Bash: But the hackintosh community is devoted
Bash: We will figure something out
Bash: uhh
Bash: "Yes" [citation needed]
Bash: RISC-V is a very different architecture. While ARM is a RISC-based approach, using less and more basic instructions for more efficiency, x86 uses CISC, which uses complex instructions to make longer tasks faster, but less efficient. Though RISC-V is also obviously RISC-based, the approaches don't mean the instructions are even the same
Bash: i have 5 operating systems on one drive lmao
Bash: Windows, macOS 14.7 Sonoma, macOS 15.1beta4 Sequoia, Ubuntu 24.04, and OpenCore
Bash: finally fixed the CPU name recognition
Bash: that's the cpu
Bash: what's the problem
Bash: Does 8500G look like 8700G?
Bash: Are our use cases the same?
Bash: Is your budget the same?
Bash: Pretty cheap
Bash: Left it running overnight to test stability. It crashed after 5 hours of being idle, and because of this I discovered that apparently, my exact GPU (The RX 6700X/6750XT) throws a kernel panic when macOS's Dynamic Wallpaper feature (A wallpaper where the lighting changes with the time of day) updates a certain number of times it causes a kernel panic.
Bash: It's so intriguing, everyone else with a 6700XT or 6750XT who I have tested with has the same issue. 6600 XT? Fine. 6950 XT? Fine.
Bash: It is a driver error, you're right. An error with a community driver for Radeon 6000 series GPUs called NootedRX.
Bash: Unfortunately the developer DMCAs all forks
Bash: And he also doesn't maintain it well
Bash: EXACTLY
Bash: So
Bash: I am not forking it
Bash: However
Bash: I am starting from scratch
Bash: And if you ever ever done reverse engineering on AMD binaries
Bash: Let's just say this will take months
Bash: It is not worth the time for the Dynamic Wallpaper feature.
Bash: Every non-Dynamic wallpaper works fine
Bash: Pinned a message.
Bash: I need to learn how Apple shoots their screensavers
Bash: Watch the video i am about to send
Bash: That sent instantly tf
Bash: Unfortunately timed, i 
caught the loop reset that happens once every ten minutes
Bash: Interesting
Bash: What format is it in that allows it to accelerate and decelerate with perfect smoothness and losslessness
Bash: I imagined a guy walking veery carefully with a gimbal
Bash: Lol
Bash: I think it's on the editing side because you can enter or exit the screensaver at any position
Bash: I would suggest listening to photo of home by jamal green
Bash: very high quality
Bash: Also how are you
Bash: I am good, happy to be mostly done with this macOS project
Bash: Just gotta make an NTFS driver so I can mount my windows partition as readable
Bash: because there is a period in the file name, making discord think the file extension is other than it is
Bash: Oh well nvm then
Bash: Probably both reasons
Bash: Lmao
Bash: I mean i pulled it up
Bash: LMAO
Bash: That's amazing
Bash: If I were Sennheiser I would think that was so funny and put it on the real product page
Bash: This is just advertising how much it fucking sucks 😭
Bash: I can't figure out how to lock my FN key
Bash: so that they are hotkeys normally and FN keys when FN is pressed
Bash: testing dictation
Bash: Cool that works great
Bash: Enable Background data and Unrestricted data usage in settings
Bash: Try Enable chat features in google messages? assuming that is the app you use
Bash: Well shit
Bash: It could be a carrier-specific setting
Bash: Aight
Bash: I like how Apple Mail supports every single type of mail account
Bash: I can finally have them all in one place
Bash: custom email servers and microsoft exchange servers
Bash: i think
Bash: what's wrong with jpg
Bash: do you usually shoot raw?
Bash: I cannot tell
Bash: That is beautiful
Bash: new phone background thanks
Bash: Fantastic
Bash: kys
Bash: lmao
Bash: no
Bash: kill yourself now
Bash: hypoasphyxiation
Bash: Idk
Bash: i made it up
Bash: using latin roots
Bash: I found a really nice enterprise 18Tb HDD that I might get for my music library
Bash: it's only $200
Bash: https://a.co/d/gx0Q98C
Bash: show me more landscape/nature photos of yours
Bash: No
Bash: I don't think
Bash: But look anyways
Bash: Figured
Bash: Because people who develop softwares dont use them lmfao
Bash: I have been trying to figure out why motherboard manufacturers are so freaking terrible at making software
Bash: Oh
Bash: https://www.ebay.ca/itm/395507993940 ***
Bash: Any time
Bash: Wdym
Bash: Ok 💀
Bash: I like the stats readouts
Bash: stfu
Bash: i should have never told you about vencord
Bash: what format is the volume
Bash: huh?
Bash: wtf is the message
Bash: there is no unbiased media
Bash: sorry bud
Bash: Everything has moderated results
Bash: Everything
Bash: there is no unbiased results
Bash: They do not exist
Bash: Yes that is what I am saying
Bash: It's all brainwash
Bash: Nothing online is unbiased anymore
Bash: the truth is dead
Bash: that's not how that works
Bash: And the results?
Bash: I do not fucking understand what any of this means
Bash: I try not to care too much
Bash: Look where you made it buddy
Bash: PinDMS
Bash: I would like to test something, put discord out of focus and unmute me if I am muted
Bash: Did you get a notification for this message?
Bash: What about this message?
Bash: Another plugin
Bash: This is weird
Bash: Tonight I felt like I barely slept at all
Bash: But
Bash: Maybe it's because I did that get much deep sleep?
Bash: Maybe
Bash: Ye
Bash: Why did you saying "After i take my jacket off" and then you taking your jacket off make me absolutely fucking die laughing
Bash: Would you like to have an idea of why I would like to throw my PC and tim cook off a bridge into a burning tar lake?
Bash: I spent all night making this
Bash: And it doesn't even work
Bash: But it looks hard to make right
Bash: well it was and it doesn't even work
Bash: :[
Bash: yes
Bash: 9/11 would reccomend 💀
Bash: if you try to add a blank review
Bash: i also got banned from it temporarily lol
Bash: I tried to add "Based Canadian photographer. Literally a retard because he keeps showing me how retarded I am and I don't like that. Literally such a stupid mf. 9/11 would recommend."
Bash: Pinned a message.
Bash: lmao what 💀
Bash: ok
Bash: Lmao
Bash: banned from a vencord plugin is WILD
Bash: I wonder how many people will notice the pfp change
Bash: It's almost like I told you
Bash: https://thetechmage.com/
Bash: Can you tell that the css and animation is inspired by apple.com
Bash: Look what I found
Bash: prolly cuz its .mov
Bash: Isn't it beautiful?
Bash: i have alternatives if you want them
Bash: i am converting the entire 30 minute 4k 120fps video into one gif
Bash: so i can use it as my website background
Bash: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BcZWERqF9neBrde8noxGNkxg-mL-URCn?usp=sharing
Bash: there are many more
Bash: but I do not have them downloaded
Bash: I was curious thanks
Bash: that is only the landscapes tab
Bash: there is a cityscapes, underwater, and Earth tab as well
Bash: i have 2 terabytes and I pay $19.99/month for it
Bash: I am going to download all of the wallpapers
Bash: and then after I upload them to Google Drive i will delete the local copies
Bash: Yes, but I prefer google
Bash: The overall cloud services are better and more developed, upload and download speeds are faster, it looks better imo
Bash: I use the full google suite as well
Bash: for example i use Google Docs not Word
Bash: Subjectively better then
Bash: I prefer to use docs.google.com because then an application isn't taking up space on my computer
Bash: this is correct, but on Linux, ChromeOS, and macOS it is a different story, and those are the operating systems I grew up using.
Bash: How does Neofetch know it is a hackintosh
Bash: You would think it was that simple, but I have a valid Apple Inc. SMBIOS
Bash: Yes because *i* injected a DeviceProperty tag that sets the name to that. Otherwise, Apple would print "3.55Ghz Unknown Processor"
Bash: Maybe I forgot to have it set to macOS instead of hacOS in the NVRAM settings
Bash: Russia recently moved short-range nuclear weapons into Belarus
Bash: I fear that WW3 will happen in the next year
Bash: Poland is on the path to becoming one of the strongest nations in Europe though
Bash: Wanna play a game?
Bash: https://openguessr.com
Bash: Invite code is gzy6biv9
Bash: It does not look like you are in the room
Bash: gzy6biv9 is the code
Bash: maybe I need to re-host
Bash: The new code is `8058370m`
Bash: bro lives in canada
Bash: and doesnt know what canada looks like
Bash: Shoot I guessed wrong, it's South Africa not Australia
Bash: Nah you get better
Bash: i have been playing for a long time
Bash: I thought you might be inherintly good
Bash: idk cuz you're
Bash: you
Bash: GEE i wonder where this is
Bash: Okay lindon
Bash: English road name right
Bash: And also
Bash: Does ireland have fucking deserts?
Bash: 💀
Bash: hmmmm
Bash: true
Bash: Okay think first
Bash: Road name is CO-13
Bash: Mountains look like Rocky mountains
Bash: American architecture on the fence
Bash: I am going to guess eastern Colorado
Bash: I can see where you guessed on the map
Bash: I am trying to teach you the process
Bash: Those are not US power lines they are European
Bash: M02, looks like a highway
Bash: Fauna looks more eastern
Bash: and since it has infrastructure
Bash: I will guess ukraine
Bash: but who was right
Bash: lmao
Bash: last one
Bash: oh wait nvm
Bash: Awww you're sick, me too
Bash: Sorry I hope you feel better 💀
Bash: True
Bash: DUh
Bash: Do you see the issue
Bash: Apple cannot do math apparently
Bash: But it says macOS is taking up the whole disk
Bash: so 200gb is just ... vanished
Bash: Why
Bash: I love ruining jokes
Bash: Want free Office 365 permenantly?
Bash: `irm https://get.activated.win | iex` in powershell will activate Office 365 suite lol
Bash: You can also use it to activate windows
Bash: Meaning no more windows keys ever
Bash: I tried it today
Bash: Works great
Bash: i'm pretty sure the hwid method just applies a generic key and then generates some files to make windows believe it's been activated. it may also do things like change the registered region/edition first to achieve this.

i believe the kms method sets your kms server to a custom one and then requests activation with a generic key. since this is a custom server, it replies that the key is valid and now it's activated. i don't know if it uses an online server or if it hosts a temporary one on your machine in this case
Bash: https://massgrave.dev/genuine-installation-media
Bash: Ye?
Bash: Woah
Bash: That is good money
Bash: Why did you wait so long to send that
Bash: Oh wait, I forgot how far west you are
Bash: Almost 4 years without Silksong news
Bash: windows ltsc iot enterprise ftw
Bash: no bloat
Bash: I am gonna buy a few SSDs this week to aid in development
Bash: rn i just have 1 500gb 🤣
Bash: I think I will get two 2tbs, one with Windows, one with macOS, and the 500gb i'll probably put Linux on. And then I need to find a half gig USB thumb drive to host the EFI on, airgapped from each OS
Bash: I'll design a boot menu with icons to select which OS is booted into upon startup
Bash: Another thing I admire about macOS. If you sign into microsoft and google in the online accounts section, it automatically adds your cloud storage locations as local disks
Bash: See, a lot of people hate on macOS, but it's quite powerful, *when you know how to use it*. It is a learning curve, like Linux, but it is quite powerful.
Bash: And it is beautiful as well
Bash: Steam is based
Bash: red hat?
Bash: oh wait it literally says
Bash: wait wtf
Bash: what is that os
Bash: 💀
Bash: This is almost as bad as AmogOS
Bash: Also I found a genius tool called Ventoy where you can create a USB with multiple ISOs on it, so I have a single USB drive with Windows 11 IoT Enterprise, Ubuntu 24.04.1, ChromeOS Flex, and some others
Bash: And you just drag and drop the image no burning required
Bash: flashing, burning, same thing. a nostalgic term for a modern thing
Bash: That's what both of those folders are
Bash: m.2, sata ssds are sometimes more expensive lol
Bash: I said macOS not Macs
Bash: i hate macs
Bash: my first laptop was an MSI and i hated the efficiency so i went macbook. I love macbooks
Bash: Macbook airs i
 mean
Bash: i dont lile the pros
Bash: theyre too stupid expensive
Bash: I was at my friend Sam's house and was showing him an orchard phobia video that reminded me of Bill Wurtz and saw your profile
Bash: lmk when you resolve davinchi
Bash: Look at this
Bash: https://github.com/alexkirsz/dispatch
Bash: I will have two WiFi cards and two ethernet connections by the end of the day, and we upgraded our router as well, so I am exited to toy with it.
Bash: Why? It's just load balancing
Bash: It's not using the multiple threads per download or upload
Bash: It spreads out tasks across the connections
Bash: 😂
Bash: have you never downloaded multiple files at once?
Bash: Okay well everyone else downloads multiple files at once
Bash: And slower networks would benefit more from this? lol
Bash: No??? Besides with 40mbps how woulds you even know that. I swear you make up shit
Bash: 💀💀💀❗️❗️❗️???? TO GET THE FILES FASTER???
Bash: This clearly says 25, 30 megabytes per second
Bash: Not 500
Bash: 500 megabits = 59.98 megabytes
Bash: Actually the M is lowecase as well, nullifying your point
Bash: listen im sorry we're doing this thing again
Bash: Let's stfu
Bash: How are you
Bash: Lmao
Bash: How do I change which wallpaper to use with PUSH?
Bash: I can't get it off the default
Bash: well it worked so
Bash: thanks
Bash: What does handed in my hours mean
Bash: Proprietary mouse cable? Lol at least yours detaches
Bash: Morning
Bash: Reverse engineering Apple drivers and frameworks is so difficult. It's like handing someone a circle and telling them to write a formula for pi. I have about a mile to go and i've made a foot of progress over the past few days.
Bash: I am trying to just make a *simple* WiFi driver for my on-board WiFi, which is a MediaTek 330 chipset.
Bash: ?
Bash: I mean it isn't good or bad
Bash: What sucks is the lack of documentation
Bash: Oh youre still sick huh
Bash: that sucks
Bash: Lmao
Bash: Good work
Bash: You were at 60 for a while
Bash: My channel is dead rn but i haven't uploaded anything
Bash: Because retards are attracted to each other
Bash: semantic simulacrum
https://youtu.be/9eLBasRa4uY
Bash: This is my favorite
Bash: i was seeing how good I am at ambient sound design
Bash: and also that is minecraft at render distance 8,192 lol
Bash: I was also playing with some stuff i coded for that
Bash: I think you were blocked during my 2 week minecraft phase
Bash: Yeah lol
Bash: I have about, 12 consistent watchers
Bash: I do a lot of work on ProtoMechanic's channel and The Arrangers channel and they both have around 2k subs
Bash: I can almost perfectly play Can you Hear the Music from Oppenheimer i will probably record that soon
Bash: huh?
Bash: Oh
Bash: Lol
Bash: Theyre my friends Miles and Sam respectively
Bash: Miles is homeschooled if that helps explain
Bash: No
Bash: I imagine them
Bash: timing is very difficult
Bash: Lol
Bash: Do you think a proximity based Bluetooth key would be a good idea? So your PC unlocks when your phone is near it?
Bash: I know Windows has something that locks your PC when your bluetooth goes out of range
Bash: Why would the thief have my phone?
Bash: No, that would be as annoying as unlocking the PC. It assumes that if you are within 10 feet of your computer then you could see someone trying to use it.
Bash: So then you'd get your phone AND pc stolen lmao
Bash: Lmao
Bash: Good video
Bash: seen it before
Bash: Sure
Bash: my windows never does that 😂
Bash: Save this into a .bat script and add it as a shortcut then pin shortcut to desktop or taskbar
Bash: @echo off
start explorer.exe /max
exit
Bash: Or right click 😂
Bash: Alternatively we can create a custom event and then a task based on the event to detect when you open it and automatically resize it
Bash: No, not sure I do, task scheduling is complex
Bash: stfu im typing
Bash: Open Event Viewer with `Win`+`R`, type `eventvwr.msc` and hit enter.

Go to Windows Logs > Application.

On the right hand side click **Create Custom View**.

In the window that opens, under `Logged`, leave it as `Any Time`. 

In the `By Source` dropdown, select `Winlogon` or `Application` depending on what is available.

In `Event ID`, enter `1000`, which is the ID for Application Starts.

Name and save the viewer.

Press `Win` + `R` again, but this time type `taskschd.msc` and hit enter.

On the right pane click **Create Task**.

Name the task and check **Run with Highest Privileges**.

Navigate to the **Triggers** tab.

Click new. From the `Begin Task` dropdown select `On an event`.

For `Log` choose `Application`.

For `Source` select the source you used earlier, likely `Winlogon`.

For Event ID type `1000`.

Navigate to the **Action** tab.

Click **new** and set the action to **Start a program**. 

In the program/script field enter `explorer.exe`.

In the **add arguments** field enter `/max`.

Save the task and exit Task Scheduler.

Log off and log in to activate.
Bash: That is off the top of my head to idk if it will work as expected
Bash: Whelp
Bash: Is that a registry editor?
Bash: Oops
Bash: nah
Bash: I should do that
Bash: Yeah
Bash: Windows is lame
Bash: Honestly... at this point... I may use macOS as my daily driver and have windows for gaming
Bash: This is a test
```zsh
security find-generic-password -D "AirPort network password" -a "Wi-Fi Network Name" -gw
```
Bash: Is the text colored at all on your end?
Bash: YAY
Bash: zsh shell script formatting works
Bash: Wait are you using the same plugins as me lol
Bash: ```ps1
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework
[System.Windows.MessageBox]::Show('Test')
```
Bash: What about this?
Bash: Shell again?
Bash: Yay!
Bash: so `ps1` is for PowerShell
Bash: Dude this is wild
Bash: GPT-o1
Bash: https://chatgpt.com/share/66f97fec-dc94-8003-8eff-da5ff0d512df
Bash: mp3s are fine
Bash: you didnt notice
Bash: 320kbps is good
Bash: I recently updated the drivers on my on-board audio and now I can actually set it to 192Khz 32-bit and it's actually a huge difference from 48Khz 24-bit
Bash: Nah, and I don't give a fuck if you call bullshit, I'm happy with the difference
Bash: I kinda cooked here
Bash: pls do not redistribute it is unsigned atm
Bash: It is an exe
Bash: So nothing
Bash: Oh
Bash: it is a music piracy script
Bash: Uhhh, you can turn on your VPN in settings?
Bash: And then it will have to use the VPN network ??
Bash: As a hacker
Bash: What
Bash: You want it to open a window that runs cmatrix so you can watch while it downloads?
Bash: ... ok
Bash: Discord
Bash: Wtf is mastodon
Bash: You are what you were assigned at birth
Bash: There is no way around it
Bash: ???
Bash: Lindon... you are so smart and so retarded
Bash: Everyone is assigned at birth the same gender they see during conception unless they got it wrong. If it has a dick it's assigned male. Duh.
Bash: Oh lol
Bash: Yeah that is a better name
Bash: I wish discord notifications would stfu
Bash: I cant do things on my phone when notifs get in the way constantly
Bash: Always
Bash: or discord mods who dont go outside
Bash: Try it out
Bash: What is an application that would be useful to you on windows
Bash: i am bored
Bash: And now that I know how to package executables i wanna make more
Bash: It could be a bit complicated because the name of the mount point could vary but I will see what I can do
Bash: Please use `wmic diskdrive list brief` to verify that
Bash: That doesn't seem like a device ID
Bash: Cool, thanks
Bash: Skip duplicate files, got it. If there is already a folder with the same date it will append new files to that folder. Operations will be read-only to prevent corruption. Would you like it to have any sort of notifications letting you know that a drive with a DCIM folder has been detected and the files have been imported? Or do you just want it to happen.
Bash: Okay so directories can't have a slash in the name I am pretty sure
Bash: Because that's how they are separated
Bash: I haven't tried tho
Bash: easy
Bash: It will be dated mm/dd/yyyy
Bash: if you don't mind
Bash: idfk what your date was
Bash: year month date??
Bash: the heck
Bash: okay how about Year/Month/Day then
Bash: okay thats cursed but alr
Bash: I will do it yy_mm_dd
Bash: and on the days for SOME reason I will not add a 0 in 1-9
Bash: because wtf
Bash: 😭
Bash: no i mean how the day is 9 not 09
Bash: amuiydg bwe
Bash: sure
Bash: yes, I will provide you with an installer that will add the .exe to your path, and add a checkbox to open at login
Bash: i have to make my drive letter Q for testing 💀
Bash: Nah i cant nvm
Bash: ill just assume it works
Bash: 💀
Bash: You're a genius
Bash: nah im too lazy
Bash: nobody else will use this script
Bash: No i didnt 💀
Bash: give me some photos to put on a drive to simulate
Bash: actually i might have some
Bash: no wait
Bash: i need your dumb format
Bash: no i dont i can just import everything
Bash: haha
Bash: i aint readin allat
Bash: i have an extremely beta application done
Bash: i have to get off soon so I am speedrunning
Bash: you will have to manually add Auto Importer to startup programs rn i haven't added that yet
Bash: Oh shit the drive name is still C
Bash: i forgot to change it to q
Bash: Why do you have a DCIM folder on your disk
Bash: wtf is my exe doing
Bash: it just says hello goodbye 💀
Bash: okay well here is the python script for you you can test that i guess
Bash: `python lindon.py` and just leave the terminal window minimized
Bash: go ahead and see if it does what it is supposed to do
Bash: with Q drive letter lol
Bash: Run it, minimize it, and it should detect the drive when it is plugged in.
Bash: It checks every 5 seconds
Bash: in a minimal way as well
Bash: so dont worry about it
Bash: uses watchdog to detect when windows sees a new drive
Bash: then looks inside that drive
Bash: 6 seconds ish
Bash: well look at the window
Bash: is it actively printing
Bash: Its good
Bash: try it
Bash: Not just the current day
Bash: Oop
Bash: Forgot to add check if folder already exists in target location
Bash: Good luck bud
Bash: yes it has a specific destination
Bash: Screenshot how the folders are named in the source folders
Bash: Is the date scheme the same
Bash: Wtf is that naming scheme
Bash: How am I supposed to work with that 💀

Bash: Look and see what's up
Bash: It walks all folders for any files modified that day
Bash: It only imports once upon the drive being plugged in
Bash: It compares source files with destination
Bash: it cant determine what you want or not...
Bash: the AI is
Bash: this is a python
Bash: and my coder name is Red Eye, Inc.
Bash: Yeah but terminal window..
Bash: I will continue to improve it then package it
Bash: Yw
Bash: Good
Bash: Did you watch the debate?
Bash: It was retarded they only asked Trump questions
Bash: The media is sooo fucking biased
Bash: And the media controls the elections now
Bash: Because our country is chock full of retards
Bash: Its a choice between the lesser of two evils
Bash: and trump at least isnt evil to that extent
Bash: Chromebooks arent actually that bad
Bash: they get memed on
Bash: You seem to like forming subjective opinions on things you have never touched
Bash: Just an observation
Bash: Yes it is
Bash: But it's not poorly put together. I am able to have a full development suite using the Crosh shell and Linux IDE, with no difficulties at all, with easy cloud integration.
Bash: It helps that it's all made by one development team, Google
Bash: Dude... I used these computer through elementary and high school. How long have you used them? Oh right
Bash: The OS is great
Bash: The hardware is shit
Bash: But the price makes up for it
Bash: ChromeOS
Bash: gottem
Bash: Yes? Among other things??
Bash: It's not really a mobile OS or really android either
Bash: it just has google play
Bash: as the app store
Bash: and uses the apk format for apps
Bash: its more linux than android
Bash: its like google linux
Bash: I have a question
Bash: Why are you so hell bent on hating something or finding fault in something that doesn't affect you at all
Bash: Experience earns opinion
Bash: Good answer
Bash: Idk why im defending it 😭
Bash: Have you tried Windows Millennium?
Bash: I was using simpler thoughts because it both is and isnt android... its like a proprietary android where all the apps were made by one team, and they did a hella good job,... but it's integrated with linux as well
Bash: Lmao all the worst ones are just windows 🤣
Bash: Google AI aah answer
Bash: My favorite OS is macOS 10.10 Yosimite
Bash: cuz nostalgia
Bash: i did homeschool on that sucker while i was growing up
Bash: it had NVIDIA 6400M graphics with 256mb of vram, 4gb ddr3 1333mhz, and an Intel Core Duo 1.08Ghz CPU
Bash: intel core duo
Bash: one of the first generation of multicore cpu
Bash: No
Bash: Idk
Bash: I think maybe there might be one smart furry in the world
Bash: this guy used his head
Bash: Try this, it should work a bit better.
Bash: I also spent some time optimizing it to run with as little resources as possible, but it is untested. If you want to try the optimized script, it is here:

```py
import subprocess as s,sys;s.check_call([sys.executable,"-m","pip","install","psutil","plyer"])
import os,shutil,time
from datetime import datetime as dt
from plyer import notification as n
import psutil as p
def G(d):
 for a in p.disk_partitions():
  if'removable'in a.opts or a.fstype=='':d.append(a.mountpoint)
def F():
 d=[];G(d)
 for a in d:
  b=os.path.join(a,'DCIM')
  if os.path.exists(b):return a,b
 return None,None
def T():
 a=dt.now()
 return f"{a.year%100}_{a.month}_{a.day}"
def C(b):
 a=T();c="Q:/DCIM/Photos/";d=os.path.join(c,a)
 if not os.path.exists(d):os.makedirs(d);e=0
 for f,g,h in os.walk(b):
  i=os.path.basename(f)
  if i==a:
   for j in h:
    if j.lower().endswith(('.arw','.mp4','.mov','.m4v')):
     k=os.path.join(f,j);l=os.path.join(d,j)
     if not os.path.exists(l):shutil.copy2(k,l);e+=1
 return e,d
def N(a,b):
 n.notify(title="Transfer Complete",message=f"{a} files copied to {b}",app_name="Auto Import",timeout=10)
def M():
 a=set()
 while 1:
  b,c=F()
  if b and b not in a:

Bash: dude i almost tore off my wrist just now
Bash: It caught on a nail
Bash: Oh yeah I cant go home btw lol
Bash: Might be home later at least
Bash: Might have to get hotel
Bash: a biolab caught fire and theres a bunch of chlorine in the air now lol
Bash: No? lmao
Bash: Its a massive disaster lol
Bash: im gonna fucking cry lindon
Bash: I bought the x670e for $459 in may ish
Bash: and now im fucking discontent already
Bash: cuz its 20 more bucks
Bash: 20 FUCKING DOLLARS?
Bash: Im so mad that they didnt charge $800 for it
Bash: I went ahead and boufht the x670 instead of waiting because I KNEW THEYD CHARGE 800
Bash: BUT THEY D I D N T
Bash: cool
Bash: It wont work if the first one didnt
Bash: Wdym by didnt work like its still buggy or it just doesnt work
Bash: From today?
Bash: Same file naming scheme?
Bash: bro wjy cant my shit just work 😭
Bash: Still yymmdd? with 24_9_6 instead of 24-09-06
Bash: No the code literally ignores the names and just looks at the dates
Bash: Fuck if I know
Bash: What it does:

Listens for USB drives
When USB drive connected, looks for DCIM
If DCIM found, it considers today's date, and compares it with the folders in the source.
Then it creates today's folder as a target and syncs the contents
Bash: Output, but yes
Bash: Maybe tomorrow
Bash: https://a.co/d/iGrlYuC
Bash: Why is this so cheap?
Bash: of course that is the first thing you would look for
Bash: I know it's not a bad thing it's just
Bash: Lindon will be lindon
Bash: nah it's just funny for no reason
Bash: i like cheap shit
Bash: i have more money left over
Bash: depends on what you buy
Bash: sometimes cheap stuff lasts longer
Bash: Yes.
Bash: Lots of manufacturers have been and continue to move towards planned obsolescence in their higher-end products because they know they can rob people
Bash: Good
Bash: I wanna try a Vision Pro
Bash: man bluetooth has come a long way
Bash: nowadays a a very well tuned Bluetooth headset can finally beat wired
Bash: Unfortunately even though bluetooth is now lossless, Bluetooth headphones are still compromised as they need to contain all the things to play the audio (dac, amp, battery, receiver) and wired headphones only need the speaker itself. So a wireless headphone has to do a lot of stuff, and the wired one doesn't, so the wired headphone can focus on tuning and making it sound better. This also makes wired cheaper, so it can spend more money on making the headphone better.
Bash: Bluetooth has won half the battle but needs another 7-8 years before id buy one over wired
Bash: what 💀
Bash: I was being completely serious
Bash: Bluetooth is now identical quality to a wire
Bash: As in literally identical
Bash: Your reactions are killing me
Bash: I cant stop laughing
Bash: That's not how that works-
Bash: I meant this
Bash: LDAC?
Bash: No im saying LDAC is the bluetooth codec that can wirelessly transmit anything higher than CD quality losslessly
Bash: 24-bit, 96kHz
Bash: If you have a nice DAP like a walkman or an Astell and Kern then I would totally get something like a sennheiser momentum wireless 4 instead of smth wired nowadays
Bash: that's not the codec's fault it's your phone's fault lol
Bash: It supports lossless playback at higher quality
Bash: your phone doesn't
Bash: your phone probably doesn't have Bluetooth 5.4
Bash: some of the nicer DAPs even have Bluetooth 6
Bash: source?
Bash: No like
Bash: What was your source since it was a quote
Bash: Oh ok it is definitely true then my bad you won
Bash: 💀
Bash: For your quote?
Bash: 24 bits×96,000 samples/second×2 channels=4.608 Mbps, which is within the data tranfer rate of the bluetooth 6.0 standard
Bash: hi pot, meet kettle
Bash: Working out is fun
Bash: Balena Etcher is going a bit fast...
Bash: Lmao
Bash: It's a USB drive 💀
Bash: sorry i was sleeping
Bash: Iran launched 200 ICBMs at Israel last night, the Iron Dome stopped all but one of them, and the DEMOCRATS think that Israel should NOT respond with what I believe they should respond with, which is *swift and utter destruction*.
Bash: If i stand in front of you with a machine gun and shoot at you 200 times are you gonna say "Oh that's alright i mean i dodged all the bullets so we're good bro"
Bash: No, I'd rip the weapons out of your hand and then snap your neck!
Bash: This country is a disgrace
Bash: Disaster recovery in north carolina is going swimmingly
Bash: as in the bureaucrats wont allow the National Guard as well as private helicopter pilots to literally save lives because they are concerned about helicopter collisions. As if a fucking military helicopter pilot doesnt know how to operate a helicopter
Bash: bro said one word all day
Bash: threadripper build !!
Bash: You should run it
Bash: It doesn't harm your pc
Bash: it just harms you
Bash: :D
Bash: It isn't hard
Bash: I figured out how to create a USB drive that Windows thinks is a CD. This allows me to use the Autorun feature, so I set up a autorun.inf to execute the virus. Also, the virus is now modified to use registry injection to make itself a "critical system component" that is both invisible to the user and not deletable without certain terminal tools. It also is not visible as a startup program but still executes at login.
Bash: So the only action needed is plugging in the USB drive once
Bash: the united states needs to partner with Israel to target Kharg island
Bash: it would cripple Iran
Bash: It would cripple the nuclear development and prevent assured mutual destruction
Bash: They are religiously motivated and as such will willingly die to destroy Israel with nuclear weapons
Bash: They need to understand that
Bash: They launched 200 missiles what's stopping them from launching a thousand
Bash: They already have ~3,400 according to US Intelligence
Bash: Some of which are hypersonic Fattahs, capeable of mach ~15 speeds
Bash: They are also actively preparing nuclear weapons
Bash: Iran showed itself capable of reaching any target in the Middle East and will, within the year, be able to launch nuclear warheads.  Iran is undoubtedly being helped by Russia and North Korea.  Inexplicably, President Biden declared, after Iran’s show of force, he is opposed to Israel destroying Iran’s nuclear capabilities.
Bash: Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced Iran was within weeks of producing enough uranium for a nuclear bomb.
Bash: i am using some fishy tool to modify the firmware of my USB drive
Bash: https://flashboot.ru/files/file/697/ Found it deep in a russian website
Bash: FUNNY MESSAGE
Bash: Ur good idc
Bash: I made a virus
Bash: wanna test it out
Bash: Photography gear?
Bash: Mornin
Bash: Nah i love working when its overcast
Bash: Or are you looking to shoot today
Bash: unfortunately my phone is about to die
Bash: The battery has been replaced, the screen has been replaced, and now the charging port is damadged, the new screen is damadged...
Bash: i got an iPhone 12 Mini, refurbished/used, for $210 to replace it.
Bash: i must say I am slightly excited for an upgrade, going from 4.7in LCD/IPS to 5.4in OLED with a phone that is actually smaller which I prefer it will be nice
Bash: incorrect .. about what
Bash: what did i say this time
Bash: The screen is larger but the phone is smaller
Bash: Do you prefer smaller screens?
Bash: I don't really use my phone much enough to care, most of the content viewing I do is on my PC
Bash: Oh, yeah I am just used to that
Bash: Alr
Bash: Oki
Bash: It's literally irrelevant anyways
Bash: You won't be using my phone 😭
Bash: That skid steer is awful
Bash: makita ftw
Bash: wait not makita
Bash: what am i thinking
Bash: I meant kubota
Bash: i worked in landscaping for 5 years?
Bash: so
Bash: yes i do
Bash: Yes?? why would I say it's shit if i haven't
Bash: I actually choose to form opinions on things I have experience with
Bash: Cough
Bash: I didn't say I couldn't
Bash: I said kubotas are generally better
Bash: which I also have experience with
Bash: Anyways
Bash: Is the weather cleared up yet
Bash: You should try to melt it to see if it is real carbon fiber
Bash: I was joking 💀
Bash: Btw can I just say that I hate DEF
Bash: its retarded
Bash: Lmao
Bash: I wish I was you there
Bash: Diesel Exhaust Fluid, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) required diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) for new heavy-duty highway engines in 2010. It makes engines last a lot less long than they could, and costs money that shouldn't need to be spent imo. Who tf cares about global warming
Bash: pre-2010 used trucks are almost as expensive as new ones because people want pre-def engines
Bash: That is illegal unfortunately
Bash: And it is integrated into the engine
Bash: And it is why newer engines are less relibable
Bash: Other than yknow, planned obsolescence
Bash: real
Bash: Honestly Face ID is going to be the best part tbh, I often have wet/dirty hands from work and checking messages without having to touch the screen will be nice
Bash: Thank you
Bash: My fingerprint reader works... 20% of the time on a good day. Lol
Bash: Both 💀
Bash: yes
Bash: Woah
Bash: Sup
Bash: Lol your status
Bash: You don't know the lore?
Bash: It's c418's older brother
Bash: Its fine
Bash: I don't get it
Bash: Has it come yet?
Bash: What's shipping time usually like in CA?
Bash: Y'all don't have amazon?
Bash: 😭🙏💀
Bash: I've been doing a lot of running and a smaller lighter phone is much easier to run with
Bash: Voltage is not a measurement of capacity
Bash: No

Health of a battery relates to its ability to retain charge over time

As batteries age or degrade, they lose their ability to hold the same amount of charge as when they were new. This degradation isn’t directly measured by the voltage a battery delivers; instead, it’s more accurately assessed through changes in its capacity and performance over time

Voltage is *completely irrelevant*
Bash: I am correct
Bash: I *actually* go to college for this
Bash: Have for three years
Bash: Charging a battery has literally nothing to do with its performance voltage
Bash: Literally
Bash: Nothing
Bash: No correlation
Bash: This is 
basic fundamentals
Bash: Not hard
Bash: "but if the battery was what it claimed to be, charging to the rated voltage would result in factory runtime" is what you said, no?
Bash: "charging to the rated voltage" isn't a correct statement
Bash: Well then nice job being incorrect i guess?
Bash: He is though
Bash: And the funny part is he's supposedly an EE so he should know
Bash: But LiPo batteries only lose capacity over time not voltage output
Bash: YOU read the words IN THE SCREENSHOT. Ugh
Bash: Goodnight retard
Bash: 3 days left of being a civilian
Bash: I will swear in this Thursday and find out what my MOS is, where I will be stationed, and how long my contract is. I'll also get an exact ship date.
Bash: LETS GOOO its REAL
Bash: And it's in pristine condition
Bash: Very surprised
Bash: Thank you and thank you
Bash: I don't get it
Bash: I love writing papers like this for my democratic teachers and then fighting back when they give me bad grades
Bash: hey my new phones camera isnt fogged up on the inside so backlighting doesn't destroy photos
Bash: i WISH i HAD A REAL CAMERA
Bash: Caps lock lol
Bash: too lazy to fix it
Bash: 12mp is ass
Bash: I want like at least a 64mp main
Bash: preferably 108mp
Bash: I am worried about my grandparents in Florida rn
Bash: the sea level is supposed to rise by 12+ feet from hurricaine milton
Bash: and they're on the coast
Bash: LOL i got my grade brought up from a 65 to a 94 on this
Bash: They have evacuated but their condo will definitely be totally destroyed
Bash: The dunes have receded so far in the past few years from storms and they can't build a sea wall fast enough and it's just going to collapse into the ocean
Bash: It's practically garunteed
Bash: Still hasn't shipped? wow
Bash: why the fuck are you all happy
Bash: ...
Bash: are you high?
Bash: I'm not mad i am genuinely confused
Bash: Ok 💀
Bash: Sup
Bash: Hungry
Bash: Been at Ft. Gillam all day
Bash: No civilian items permitted
Bash: They do just
Bash: Im still hungry
Bash: Ok faggot there are obviously exceptions
Bash: I love eating
Bash: Because i need to be in contact with my recruiter
Bash: As if theyd pay for allat 😭
Bash: Well im a recruit so they dont care
Bash: not until I swear in
Bash: price?
Bash: then im fine with it
Bash: I'm a Marine
Bash: Damn that sucks
Bash: Shipping to Parris Island
Bash: How are multiple days the best day of your life huh
Bash: I did, and that implies that you currently think the next or current day is always/will be better than the previous/current day. This implies that "bestness" or happiness has no ceiling, rendering the entire meaning of happiness meaningless.
Bash: Without contrast it has no meaning
Bash: So just "+1" every day?
Bash: That is not realistic but I suppose you could argue that each day is "better" than the one before it, perhaps for a few days, but then after a few days it becomes statistically improbable and eventually impossible because you must have negative experiences as well
Bash: That's the whole reason people say their day was good or bad
Bash: Because it is a scale with a ceiling
Bash: You are correct there
Bash: But I expect this status to change by the time that you will statistically have a "bad" experience
Bash: I've been laughing at myself this whole time btw
Bash: Yeah
Bash: Ok
Bash: Nah ps2 to 480v AC
Bash: It's not
Bash: Good morning
Bash: Pinned a message.
Bash: I woke up at 6 am today, drank a glass of water, ran for two miles (my time was 15:35), and came home and made myself breakfast. And i am proud of myself. Wouldn't you like to be able to say you're proud of yourself?
Bash: Yay!
Bash: Omg
Bash: Ye
Bash: Useful
Bash: Ok
Bash: that's USB for ya
Bash: Because cache
Bash: throttling
Bash: Actually there is a way apparently
Bash: What did I do this time
Bash: Okay i'll explain
Bash: you said this
Bash: And thats why i said that because Look at your screenshot 💀
Bash: The screenshot shows slower speeds. You said theres no way these speeds are this slow
Bash: I was being humorous
Bash: Nah
Bash: get up
Bash: out of bed
Bash: I've just been sleeping until i don't feel foggy
Bash: which has been taking me 9 ish hours on average
Bash: im playing around with a steam scammer rn
Bash: 🤡
Bash: me when I lost my discord account 😭
Bash: its a lesson i will never have to learn again
Bash: i don't hogwash
Bash: it was a lapse of judgement is all
Bash: Sure
Bash: "Thanks for giving me all this information" was me subtly letting them know that they are screwed
Bash: I am a bit impressed with their initial screenshot though
Bash: The timestamps are good
Bash: yeah that sucks
Bash: I have my windows install set up to have a rollback update point kinda like how macOS has the time machine feature, it periodically takes snapshots of my OS, and I'm in the windows canary program so I can test new features and report bugs
Bash: I don't understand the need to have so many extra features that will only be used once or twice that risk the integrity of the software due to little testing
Bash: Like just give me smth that works, stable and consistent
Bash: working
Bash: i learned that you dont actually need to buy anything
Bash: I just haven't bought the thing needing the accessory, easy
Bash: See but my mindset is you don't *need* the gimbal. You don't *need* the camera either. All i have purchased is my rent and food. in the past month
Bash: Sure im a sad fuck cuz of it but i also am a rich sad fuck
Bash: neither lol
Bash: i work on my own time essentially
Bash: deck
Bash: no another deck
Bash: decks are fast
Bash: 3 days max usually
Bash: nice folder name
Bash: get one or two 22tb enterprise seagate drive for $240
Bash: (each)
Bash: That's a plan
Bash: Have you considered an NVMe M.2 RAID PCIe card
Bash: Do you need 24tb?
Bash: So what's the aversion to using a few enterprise HDDs with just good ol raid software
Bash: Plugged into mobo
Bash: my motherboard has built
in RAID configuration
Bash: You only have 2?
Bash: Damn
Bash: Yeah a new X870E mobo is still cheaper than that enclosure lol
Bash: As fast as the storage medium
Bash: Likely 6Gbit per connection and the ProArt boards have 4 sata connections so 24 Gbits
Bash: Im not sure what other mobos have built in raid
Bash: And then you can get 4 16tb drives for like $700 total
Bash: or 22s for $1k
Bash: and have virtually infinite storage
Bash: a ProArt B550 + 4X 8Tb HDD (enterprise NAS 7200rpm) = $953 USD
Bash: And thats all new parts
Bash: It will be internal so no cables
Bash: Nope
Bash: I said what i said
Bash: 8
Bash: nah
Bash: you werent being an asshole you were just incorrect
Bash: i agree
Bash: btw ill prolly be an asshole soon
Bash: accidentally had a bunch of red40
Bash: literally triggers my adhd/autism so hard
Bash: No
Bash: Stfu no
Bash: Multiples of 8 are more satisfying
Bash: Average non American mentality
Bash: WHAT THE FUCK IS A KILOMETER 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Bash: Womp womp
Bash: I forgot about Bobert
Bash: bro its already fucking with my head and its been 20 minutes
Bash: red 40 should be illegal
Bash: redred2020*
Bash: Stop encouraging my autism
Bash: Heeeheheheheh JESUS
Bash: it requires decent pressure on a surface and a trigger pull and compressed air to fire a nail
Bash: Ok
Bash: Kkk
Bash: Kys
Bash: kill yourself
Bash: safely
Bash: Gonna get back to work
Bash: should be done by 4:30 EST
Bash: Home
Bash: went a bit later than usual
Bash: people who don't want to go broke
Bash: people who don't want to spend money unnecessarily
Bash: buddy for all you do
3000 series is good value all im sayin
Bash: get a 5900xt or smth
Bash: you're a photographer and videographer
Bash: what do you need big new cpu for
Bash: yeah so get a 9950x then, have fun spending a bootyload on the ram and mobo to support it
Bash: Or just save money and render overnight
Bash: what cpu do you have now
Bash: FOR PRODUCTIVITY
Bash: OUIYG@D IUYFG! O#@DP
Bash: hAHHAHAHAAH
Bash: What is bro using the $100 vcache for 😭
Bash: LMAO
Bash: get a 7600x or wait for 9800X3D
Bash: cuz it will actually be usable in workloads
Bash: well its debatable but it depends on how they split up the vcache across the cpu die
Bash: could be good could be shit
Bash: we don't know since 9000 series x3d chips are rumors rn
Bash: 9000 is always better than 7000 duh
Just terrible value bad launch prices
Bash: what do YOU think the answer to that question is
Bash: So why did you ask
Bash: I never suggested you do this
Bash: I said get a 5900XT
Bash: I made it better
Bash: No dip sherlock what do you think a 5900XT fits into
Bash: an honest mistake
Bash: the name is confusing
Bash: What happens after 10 series of GPUs
Bash: That's already what they do
Bash: It will likely be a new three letter scheme
Bash: PTX or smth
Bash: Idk why they didnt start at RTX 180 instead of 1080
Bash: Or just
Bash: Pathtracing
Bash: Like RTX is raytracing
Bash: I mean they used to be in the thousands
Bash: I had a 9400M in my 2009 imac
Bash: I was falling asleep and I didn't wanna have to wake myself up to comment on it
Bash: What did you do to the pc
Bash: intrustive thoughts
Bash: i wanna connect 19,584 9v batteries in series and then touch the jumper cables together
Bash: The capacity of a `9v` battery is about `550 mAh`. So, we can convert that to Coulombs: 

[Capacity (Ah) = 550mAh/1000 = 0.55 Ah], [Charge (C) = Capacity (Ah) x 3600s/h = 0.55 Ah x 3600s/h = 1980 C]

And then use this to calculate the energy in joules:

[Energy (J) = Voltage (V) x Charge (C) = 9 V x 1980 C = 17,820 J]

Total energy of 19,584 9V batteries = 348,986,880 Joules

= a detonation force equal to 8.34×10 ^−8 megatons (83.4 kilograms) of TNT upon connection of the jumper cables
Bash: bros boutta send me 28.5k USD 💀
Bash: "at least 5"
83.4 kilos of tnt:
Bash: Lindon
Bash: A standard 155mm artillery shell contains about 6 to 8 kilograms of TNT
Bash: The Mark 81 bomb yeilds about 113 which is the closest you can get I think
Bash: https://youtu.be/Rf2ADSI3fh8
Bash: It would be an explosion about half to 3/4ths that size
Bash: You won't be able to see shit
Bash: Without filming through a welding mask
Bash: Electrical explosions produce much more light than TNT

Bash: good stuff
Bash: WiFi 7 sheesh
Bash: Ngl I kinda like it it has come a long way
Bash: I recently switched from ethernet back to wifi
Bash: Subjective
Bash: Your WiFi 7 will have higher bandwidth and speed compared to your 2.5GbE port. But feel free to cripple yourself.
Bash: You have some sort of mental problem i think
Bash: You are really willing to die on the stupidest hills
Bash: Spending more money to be able to win an argument is still losing the argument
Bash: You do release that WiFi 7 is faster than Cat 8 ethernet right?
Bash: It's up to 46Gbps
Bash: Over distances of 80-100 feet, by the way.
Bash: Just try to beat that with a cable.
Bash: You can't. Cat 9 Ethernet doesn't exist.
Bash: In my use case? I'm 10 feet from my router unobstructed.
Bash: It's a win all the way
Bash: all i hear is struggling to cope
Bash: why does your canadian ISP ass care you get under a gig lmfao
Bash: you could use cat 5 💀😭
Bash: You're resorting to fiber? Bro has infinite money
Bash: And we both know canada has such bad fiber coverage thay its funny
Bash: nah i was being fr
Bash: I'm not advocating for wireless specifically I tend to just lean towards things that are faster
Bash: no im going back to sleep
Bash: Irrelevant question. What the fuck do you do on your pc that requires the extremely slight latency decrease using ethernet
Bash: Because you dont
Which means WiFi7 is better
Bash: Its fuckin built into the new mobo mate 💀
Bash: Nah.
Bash: Because it's one less cable. Plus it's actually free. Comes with the motherboard
Bash: You were talking about fiber.....
Bash: lol
Bash: It will run at the fastest your router can support. You dont need wifi 7 for it to be better
Bash: Wifi 6 would still be better. Your ISP plan says so at least
Bash: Sounds like a case of user error, haven't had problems on my end
Bash: What does that matter 💀
Bash: The air doesnt care how many wifi routers there are 💀
Bash: i have about 40 "interfering" networks in my area and they dont do shit
Bash: bro doesn't know networking
Bash: i'm actually CompTIA Networking+ certified
Bash: I don't try to argue with you about cameras. But you have to be right about everything, sheesh. Take a hike, you lost.
Bash: heard of a "neighborhood"?
Bash: Well the way I set it up and use it, it's both fast and reliable. So win for me. Sorry you gotta stick with the wires
Bash: you're making a fool of yourself here, you just don't know it. Probably because of the whole fool thing
Bash: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420660/Neva/
Bash: buy me this
Bash: i'll probably pay you back
Bash: cuz i have it locked so i have to wait to buy stuff
Bash: bought it
Bash: and it's absolutely stunning
Bash: Dude the PFT for the Marines is going to kill me
Bash: I have to complete 23 pull-ups, perform 115 crunches in 2 minutes (Or hold a plank for 3:45 minutes), and run 3 miles in 18 minutes or less. To pass.
Bash: It's gonna take work
Bash: i can't stand up in the shower rn and i can barely get my arms up to my head to wash my hair

Bash: It was like a German saying "its edible" if i asked them if they liked the meal I made them
Bash: the discount is actually really good
Bash: 58% off
Bash: yeah, ublock orgin doesn't unblock background video playback, and I usually watch videos at work with my screen off, for things like listening to debates or learning languages or catching up on news
Bash: And i want to support everyone I watch too
Bash: HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE X86 PACT
Bash: sorry its just smth im actually excited about
Bash: Intel, AMD, Broadcom, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Red Hat formed the X86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, committed to improving and developing the x86 architecture to get an upper hand on ARM. It could mean some serious improvements for existing CPUs
Bash: It's not a physical improvement
Bash: x86 is an instruction set
Bash: BIOS is not instruction set
Bash: it's complicated
Bash: and im not smart enough to explain
Bash: It would be an OS update
Bash: BIOS is chipset
Bash: Nobody has that much to give away
Bash: Mr beast doesn't even give away that much per month
Bash: yes
Bash: money requires work
Bash: 80% of people are poor because theyre retarded

Bash: What if light and gravity are just interpretations of physical metadata being updated across space-time at a set speed, which means quantum mediae are possible to predict in a future state because there is a set amount of metainformation to exist and it may only update at a set speed which is c, and this is why lights and gravity are particles and waves? 

the total amount of metainformation that can be updated across space-time (reality) in one Planck's constant would be a fixed amount in this scenario, a unit which for the sake of conversation we can refer to as a PMB or Planck Metabit (made that up lol)
Bash: I was thinking about how if the sun dissapeared, earth would orbit the empty space for 8 minutes and 20 seconds.
Bash: Or perhaps Noeton would be a better term? From 'noesis' (Greek for 'understanding'), suggesting a basic unit of cognition or metainformation.
Bash: I simply offer a reinterpretation of light and gravity. They could be manifestations of "physical metadata" being updated across space-time at a constant speed 𝑐 (the speed of light).
Bash: Nothing *observable* is faster than c. But this theory suggests that in the scenario where the sun dissapears, the planck metabits are already set at earth's location as a stack, than can only update at C
Bash: Okay let me take a different approach to explaining
Bash: If the Sun were to suddenly vanish:

the changes in gravitational and electromagnetic fields would propagate outward at the speed of light

My concept of "Planck Metabits" (PMBs) existing as a stack at every point in space-time is similar to the field theory approach in physics.

In quantum field theory (QFT), fields permeate all of space, and particles are excitations of these fields. Changes in the field (and thus the propagation of particles or forces) occur locally and propagate at finite speeds, constrained by *c*

My theory just suggests that all points in space-time have pre-existing informational states (PMBs) that update when influenced by changes propagating at the speed of light
Bash: I think, if I am understanding what you are saying 💀
Bash: Imagine the universe as a vast network of tiny information units, like pixels on a screen. These units carry "physical metadata" about the state of the universe at each point in space and time. Let's call the smallest possible unit of this information a Planck Metabit (PMB).
Bash: Physical Metadata Updates:

Physical phenomena like light and gravity are the result of these PMBs updating their information. These updates can only happen at a maximum speed—the speed of light, denoted by c.
Bash: No information or influence can travel faster than c.
Bash: Changes in one part of the universe take time to affect other parts because the PMBs update sequentially at this constant speed.
Bash: Technically, yes.
Bash: It's physical information, not cogniscent information.
Bash: Yes 💀
Bash: RTX 6969
Bash: I created a formula for it
Bash: A formula for the rate of informational entropy

Bash: Try to guess what the one thing I am actually sad about leaving
Bash: Nah idfc i am gonna lose my ability to play the piano cuz i wont be able to practice
Bash: 4
Bash: I don't remember anything i could play 4 years ago
Bash: its not retarded they just know that regular people cant tell tell difference in resolution in everyday use so they dont go all the way upgrading both the sensor and the bandwidth between the sensor and the SoC they just update the sensor so they can slap a bigger number and nobody is the wiser
Bash: There is so little bandwidth between the iPhone 16's 48MP sensor and the SoC that it cripples the quality. It could be better if they wanted it to be better. Don't get so heated.
Bash: It's a combination of all of that
Bash: I just mentioned an additional flaw
Bash: Oh wait yall dont have the IRS
Bash: CRAnge
Bash: this is the funniest thing ive seen all week
Bash: how does the text relate to the picture
Bash: yeah but guess what
Bash: i have work off tmr

Bash: ive been getting up at 4am and it
fucking sucks
Bash: LMFAOO
Bash: NTSC is the video standard used in countries like the U.S., Canada, and Japan, while PAL is used in much of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia
Bash: NTSC typically runs at 30 frames per second (fps) with 525 lines of resolution, while PAL runs at 25 fps with 625 lines of resolution
Bash: SO THEN WHY ASK THE QUESTION
Bash: Sure
Bash: its just correct grammar, humans can do that too
Bash: On a modern portable device?
Bash: Probably just backwards compatibility
Bash: It just *can*. It takes little to no effort to add it, so why not add it, if it's a stable feature.
Bash: Also gm
Bash: Have fun
Bash: Why are you eating two meals
Bash: Or are you packing food
Bash: Wait shut up
Bash: Stfu im retarded
Bash: Dont even say anything
Bash: Kys 🫵
Bash: I still think it's hilarious that KMS is a cybersecurity acronym
Bash: Nah its ok i forgive you
Bash: Key management server
Bash: Also I did some research and
Bash: The canadian military was scary in WW2
Bash: Like
Bash: Sheesh
Bash: I respect brutal war crimes against your enemies tbh
Bash: Where are canadas balls now
Bash: Alberta is pretty big I could end up there at some point
Bash: Marines do constant join-force training exercises
Bash: Do you live near any major military installments
Bash: Here I would say I see personnel in their griefs about one or twice a month
Bash: Back in Jacksonville, I lived near NASJAX. So it was about twice a week there
Bash: Also wanna know a fun fact
Bash: SEALs are fake
Bash: They exist but
Bash: Not in the capacity they used to
Bash: The media overhypes them so much
Bash: But it's the special task forces that you have never heard of that you should fear
Bash: Morning
Bash: How was yesterday
Bash: you cant
Bash: 😭
Bash: i stayed up until like
Bash: 1
Bash: watching bodycam videos with a friend
Bash: thats a lot of time
Bash: I need to learn how to launder uniforms
Bash: The USMC gives you $800 a year just to take care of your uniform and if I can do it myself i can just pocket it
Bash: it's actually twice a year
Bash: What im saying is the SEALs still function but im pretty sure they have an entire unit just for media presence
Bash: Yes. SEALs are Navy by the way. It's confusing.
Bash: I am really stressed because I am taking a two hour defense language aptitude battery test today that will determine wether or not I qualify for a position that has a 40K signing bonus
Bash: Which I would receive 50% of straight out of boot
Bash: Which means by March id have around 22k including base pay
Bash: Yeah America really rewards its military
Bash: They pay you for everything you can think of
Bash: And im perfectly happy being single, in fact id rather be in a brotherhood where I don't have to think about relationships. But we are different people in different places in life
Bash: id rather have an RTX TITAN AI than a girlfriend 🤓
Bash: Probably cheaper 😭
Bash: Good idea
Bash: Why is it so cool
Bash: Also dude
Bash: Im gonna be a fucking unit after basic
Bash: GySgt pushes us until we break and then again and im getting mentally used to it
Bash: Like i actually fell up the stairs just from my legs failing
Bash: No wonder the US military is the strongest in the world
Bash: Ammo cans, bars, weights, other people, fucking trees, and a car
Bash: We all report to the station 5pm Tuesday and thursday
Bash: He sends a staff sergeant to pick me up
Bash: i have my permit and ill have my liscense by december
Bash: I will also get a universal military license which is cool
Bash: Good in any country
Bash: LITERALLY MY DAD
Bash: Your brain is your biggest enemy
Bash: I have discovered that my body is fully capable of doing twice as much as I thought
Bash: It's a matter of literally not giving up
Bash: You can't run another foot? Then run another mile. At a 8 minute pace. That's what my GySgt said today.
Bash: And I did it
Bash: Even though my head told me I couldn't
Bash: holy photodump
Bash: "before I couldn't do it anymore" is where you do another mile
Bash: it was so mean and uncalled for that it was funny
Bash: Too bad
Bash: Do it until you
Bash: Physically
Bash: Fall and cannot get up
Bash: Run with a buddy who can run more than you
Bash: As well
Bash: Keep pace with him until you collapse
Bash: I am so confused by the grammar
Bash: Solution: Delete the server
Bash: I dont rlly have time for that in this chapter of my life
Bash: my days are packed rn
Bash: Not technology
Bash: But more
Bash: Useless things
Bash: Like making a discord bot for randoms
Bash: Without being paid for my time
Bash: Rate my profile
Bash: The aesthetic
Bash: I suggested to Joyce (the youtuber) that she make a video off this fool
Bash: By building this user a PC with the following specs since they failed to be specific about the other parts:

- Intel Core 2 Duo E7500
- Some socket LGA 775, Intel G41 chipset motherboard 
- Generic 400W PSU (non-80 Plus rated, no PCIe connectors)
- 32GB DDR3 1066MHz RAM
- Two 2TB SATA II SSDs
- mid-tower case with no cable management and poor ventilation (circa 2005)

also modify the firmware of the GPU to only be able to work with the PCIe 2.0 X16 slot on this motherboard and not work in modern systems.
Bash: I would also prefer separate SSDs if i was a dev because some software and OSs hate being on the same drive
Bash: It can be done
Bash: everything has low level firmware
Bash: stuff can be crippled
Bash: Polling rate?
Bash: Normal is 500-1000 no?
Bash: Then yeah
Bash: I can
Bash: As long as ur not going above the capability
Bash: This is hilarious
Bash: Sleep fucktard
Bash: Fair point
Bash: Yknow what
Bash: Stay awake for 78 hours
Bash: You dont need that silly stuff called sleep anyways
Bash: Pfft
Bash: Go get em tiger
Bash: I'm just pissed cuz i wake up from a nightmare and your just still awake
Bash: Anyways gn you damn canadian
Bash: 🤓
Bash: 🫵
Bash: Same, just woke up actually lmao. Headed back to skeep after i fjnish typing
Bash: https://youtu.be/mg79n_ndR68?si=0wiFsXKIrmNnjJGk
Bash: At 6 minutes 30 seconds i caught myself laughing with pleasure
Bash: i could graduate today
Bash: i have 13 assignments left
Bash: cuz I am 30 weeks ahead in my classes 💀
Bash: here have some more motivation
Bash: im getting into blender
Bash: i hope i get some money as a grad present because this 8500G is NOT enough for blender 💀
Bash: But to be fair I am doing cloth simulation with 4096 subdivisions
Bash: My fps is 0.28 and dropping
Bash: Hehehe i am re-rendering with 32,768 subdivisions and a pathtracing light source
Bash: it only really uses cpu
Bash: mine is about 20% faster looking at cinebench and single core scores
Bash: https://youtu.be/JtfDbQlqvXQ
Bash: this feel familiar....
Bash: Erm ☝️🤓 Dont interrupt my musical endeavors, i am on my nuance arc ‼️‼️You are NOT giving off introspective vibes 😡😡😡😡
Bash: now i want a monster ultra
Bash: Ok
Bash: spotify has 320kbps Ogg vorbis
Bash: at least its better than mp3
Bash: and i personally dont have a good enough ear or equipment to hear a difference
Bash: not wearing em
Bash: letting my friend use em they're at his house
Bash: one day i swear
Bash: Im gonna make you do a blind headphone test
Bash: with the same ear foam or whatever for both
Bash: take a wpm test
Bash: the wattage 💀
Bash: I mean they are technically correct
Bash: I hope that AMD and intel don't release a new CPU next year
Bash: I hope they give their developers time to work
Bash: And make a real product
Bash: Intel literally went backwards with their 200 series chips
Bash: And AMD needs to stop capping with their marketing
Bash: Fr
Bash: My poor AIO has been cooling a peasant
Bash: might ask for a 9950X for a graduation gift
Bash: (who cares if its 200 more than a 7950X its not my money)
Bash: (no i dont need it stfu)
Bash: not really
Bash: it *is* a grad present
Bash: because people aren't snobs
Bash: 64 subdivisions
Bash: I will demonstrate 256 subdivisions soon
Bash: no need to spend the money on implimentation
Bash: Wrong. We actually need new CPUs.
Bash: What we don't need is lossless discord calls
Bash: It's called
Bash: Resource management
Bash: The CPUs we have now aren't good enough
Bash: The call quality we have now is good enough
Bash: you pulled that outta your ass 😭
Bash: 💀because they have a lot of room for improvement?
Bash: A substantial and tangible amount of improvement mind you
Bash: not an improvement only detectable by people with $500 headphones, a DAC, and a hyperbaric chamber
Bash: Lossless vs 384kbps
Bash: Maybe a presidential one 💀
Bash: The plane has cloth physics and 65K subdivisions. I am baking the physics and so far I have 17 frames done out of 250. Those 17 frames take up 556Mb.
Bash: Tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt :)
Bash: Yes I agree with ya
Bash: It is ass
Bash: But not in 384kbps vcs
Bash: At that point it's likely the end user's microphone
Bash: Another point for it
Bash: barely anyone has good mic
Bash: are those planar-magnetic ribbon tweeters
Bash: woah
Bash: good positioning as well
Bash: hmm
Bash: maybe you're not retarded
Bash: Oh
Bash: i am glad I am rendering these physics at 1080p 24fps
Bash: It would literally take weeks at 1440p 165fps
Bash: yes, it is
Bash: IF ONLY CPUS WERE FURTHER ALONG IN IMPROVEMENT, THEN IT WOULD TAKE MINUTES !!! HMMM, THIS REMINDS ME OF A CONVERSATION
Bash: bad grammar
Bash: you get the point
Bash: blender is mostly single core speed dependant, which mine is actually quite good at.
Bash: It is, it's complicated to explain, but it's a program that isn't very good at using too many cores
Bash: I am starting a stopwatch to see how long it takes to calculate the physics for one frame of my simulation
Bash: Again, it's not a single-threaded program, but it benefits much more from single core speeds
Bash: 5:07.43 per frame
Bash: At my church I am the sole person who is allowed to use a dlive c2500 with HD800s
Bash: So I technically own them
Bash: (im the only person who knows how to run a dlive)
Bash: Currently uhh
Bash: Skullcandy Crushers
Bash: Because letting friend borrow headphones
Bash: yeah :(
Bash: It's not terrible tbh
Bash: Just not wonderful like dt1990 pros
Bash: This is going to take 19.47 hours to render 💀
Bash: 100%
Bash: Ryzen 9 9950X would decrease that time from 19.47 hours to roughly 6.5 to 7.8 hours based on benchmarks
Bash: its not too laggy
Bash: Indeed
Bash: an EPYC 9654 with 192GB DDR5-6200 would bring the time down to 1.2 hours
Bash: Realistically studios would never use the amount of subdivisions I am using
Bash: It uses ram until it runs out of ram, then caches to the SSD
Bash: Depends on how much data is in the render
Bash: Usually 32 gigs is fine
Bash: I have never ignored any of them
Bash: You ask too many questions for me to bother answering. Google exists. Whenever I answer your questions you call me a retard, so just go answer them yourself
Bash: Who says I ignored it
Bash: I read your messages
Bash: No, ignoring would be not reading it in the first place
Bash: Don't take it so personally sheesh 💀
Bash: But sure
Bash: It's almost like I am often doing things or in this case we were in the middle of a separate conversation
Bash: Or i could just ignore it
Bash: That would be a fucking hilarious response
Bash: That got me so bad
Bash: The flash of anger when you said ok was so visceral
Bash: Yay you finally killed yourself
Bash: This song is so difficult
Bash: I will listen in a sec after I figure out how to force quit blender after accidentally starting a render with 1.34 quadrillion subdivisions
Bash: Any idea how to pirate Loki season 2
Bash: Sup
Bash: Finally got fluid simulation figured out, and the higher refresh rates look smoother than real life lmao
Bash: Also here is the 19 hour render
Bash: I can't figure out how to texture the water
Bash: It's also more satisfying than real life because the source is always laminar
Bash: Woah
Bash: Taking my PC with me lol
Bash: might get a mac 💀
Bash: Maybe if you can upgrade RAM and CPU 💀
Bash: What you thought I was gonna leave my child at home?
Bash: Are you pulling my leg?
Bash: Hmm
Bash: Let me know how that works out for you, I am genuinely curious
Bash: You're going to love MacOS and hate macos
Bash: I'm genuinely curious to see how you react
Bash: Just not gonna mention snapdragon laptops 😭
Bash: You want ARM so you're switching to Macbook?
Bash: Have you used MacOS before?
Bash: Have you used ARM Windows
Bash: Hmm
Bash: Good luck then
Bash: Yep, that's a two minute mac user
Bash: Rosetta is a nice thought
Bash: Wine works better than rosetta
Bash: And if youve ever used wine
Bash: Youd know thats saying smth
Bash: ..
Bash: They're equally stable tbh
Bash: Oh, easy. Your issue is adobe 💀
Bash: Yeah adobe is more stable on macos
Bash: But without picking specific apps they're equally stable
Bash: Like try running steam on macos lmao
Bash: there will always be new parts
Bash: every 6 months
Bash: I am saying there will always be new parts coming out that will be better than what you have
Bash: I have tried to make sense of what you said so many times
Bash: All the parts that you will build it with will have a *higher* performance *drop*? Compared to what?
Bash: Do you mean to say that there will be a drop in competition? A drop in performance compared to other parts? Idk wtf you're saying 😭
Bash: That's what *I* was trying to say to *you* because you said you want something that you won't have to upgrade for years
Bash: You're right
Bash: buddy you have 0
Bash: fuck off

Bash: you probably dont need to
Bash: oh idk
Bash: Claude just doxxed me first try
Bash: I presented it with this image
Bash: And it said this
Bash: "This looks like a typical suburban neighborhood in the southeastern United States. Several clues suggest this:

1. The architectural style - brick and vinyl-sided homes with two-story colonial designs
2. The wide concrete driveways and spacious lots
3. The deciduous trees that appear to be partially in fall colors
4. The yellow-painted home with the gray roof is a common style in southern suburbs
5. The landscape is relatively flat
6. The grass is still fairly green despite what appears to be fall weather
7. The general layout and spacing of the homes is very characteristic of newer (likely 1990s-2000s) southern suburban developments

This could be in states like Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, or Tennessee, where such suburban developments are very common. The combination of the architecture, vegetation, and neighborhood layout is particularly characteristic of Atlanta's suburbs or similar metropolitan areas in the Southeast.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"
Bash: I am very impressed
Bash: Yes
Bash: i need to do some doing today
Bash: I have to memorize the 11 general orders of the corps, the enlisted ranks, and the officers ranks by tomorrow i might be toast
Bash: i have like the first 7 orders down and all the enlisted ranks
Bash: Pinned a message.
Bash: thats an autistic thing that i would have said when I was 12 and genuinely meant it with genuine confusion
Bash: You would be surprised the level of precision they expect
Bash: Also, the Marines are a different branch from the Army, they're more amphibious/tip of the spear troops, first in, technically naval infantry but have evolved to be more. They're essentially the scalpel of the military
Bash: And they pretty much expect perfection and set you back until they get perfection
Bash: It's partly a culture thing partly a mental thing, they want soldiers that will not accept defeat
Bash: So by setting you back a bunch for things that you would never know how to do weeds out the quitters
Bash: This is funny
Bash: So my recruiter (Gunnery Sergeant Wiles) told me at 4am today that I will recite those things at the station tomorrow when I have to report
Bash: I wish there was a way to export all documents from word/google docs and import them
Bash: Online accounts expect people to never make new ones
Bash: Like I would pay $20 to be able to merge all data across my google accounts into one
Bash: I have 3 assignments left

Bash: Isn't that wild 💀
Bash: Floating point operations per second
Bash: i9 14900K = 1.43 TFLOPS (teraflops)

a measure of how many calculations a processor can perform in seconds
Bash: Based on the FPS charts for a 4090, the xAI can achieve 217 million FPS
Bash: Not exactly how that works but
Bash: It would take 2,383,133 RTX 4090s to equal the performance of xAI
Bash: And they are all liquid cooled
Bash: It's 61,156,250 times faster than your PC
Bash: And yes it is
Bash: there's a video tour of it
Bash: 6.8M
Bash: my cpu is designed for high TFLOPS tho
Bash: 18.8 petabytes of VRAM
Bash: what is elon musk doing with this thing
Bash: if i were him tho
Bash: id build the same thing

Bash: Since I will be moving so much I want to have my entire steam library downloaded locally to my device
Bash: I was thinking of making some sort of HDD array that I can offload games that I am not going to play for a while and then have a sort of SSD cache to put games I will be playing
Bash: because I have like 4Tb of games
Bash: My application for MOS Series 5900 Avionics Electrician was approved
Bash: figured it would be but
Bash: still nice
Bash: Marines. yes
Bash: Its fine
Bash: You're just a civvy so why would you care what the branches are 🤓
Bash: The army has 1,010,000 soldiers
Bash: The Marines have 180,000
Bash: we are much more specialized troops
Bash: and there's a lot of pride to being a Marine
Bash: its more tight knit, more of a brotherhood

Bash: There is no possible way that a self-driving car can manage to kill more people than a drunk driver
Bash: did you watch the video?
Bash: no steering wheel
Bash: uhhh
Bash: Telsa has had self-driving since 2013
Bash: it's safer than a human
Bash: Computer can see further and react faster than a human
Bash: find one
Bash: there have been 467 collisions across all Tesla autonomous vehicles since 2013
Bash: That is an extremely small number
Bash: I don't believe I asked
Bash: > Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and “many others” resulting in serious injuries.

Bash: In 2022, there were 5,930,496 motor vehicle accidents reported to the police in the United States
Bash: 6 million police-reported crashes occurring annually on average since 2013

= 0.00071% of car crashes since 2013 were due to Tesla Autopilot
Bash: Meaning you're more likely to be struck by lightning
Bash: And a large majority of those crashes were from the very early days of development
Bash: According to Tesla, in the fourth quarter of 2022, there was one crash for every 5.39 million miles driven
Bash: On average in the U.S., a vehicle crash occurs approximately every 652,000 miles driven
Bash: So it is quantifiably safer
Bash: its freezing actually
Bash: not cold
Bash: 🤓
Bash: The temperature recorded at 2:00 PM in Edmonton, Alberta was 32 degrees Fahrenheit
Bash: Lmao
Bash: I am lucky to live close to a major distribution center
Bash: I placed an order at 4PM today it should be here 5-10PM today
Bash: In the freezing weather?
Bash: Yikes

Bash: how
Bash: that's the least gay thing you can do
Bash: why not both
Bash: there's no need to balence anything really
Bash: you'd be pushing yourself too hard to equally progress your mental and physical state at once so it is intelligent to focus all out on one
Bash: now THAT is gay
Bash: read what you just said mr disney princess
Bash: are you even religious
Bash: are you some chinese ching chong master oogway dragon master with all this balance crap 💀
Bash: its all just pathology
Bash: if you take a second to look at it
Bash: there is no reason for it
Bash: The extreme pro isn't on Amazon in my region or Id get one for my MP3 player
Bash: one way I have found to be productive is to have an entirely different OS for just work
Bash: For example I use my hackintosh for school/coding
Bash: because the macOS workflow is just beautiful
Bash: but I can't play on macOS cuz it's stupid
Bash: that I have Windows for
Bash: So to open a game I have to reboot and switch OSs wich encourages me to not do that and just finish the work
Bash: is that a linux distro? I do not recognize it
Bash: Hmm
Bash: Cool
Bash: not a bad thing
Bash: being experienced in the use of something lesser can make it something better
Bash: than being a noob in smth

Bash: ill put 15k in an account for a car and save as much of the rest as I can
Bash: photography is a profession in the USMC
Bash: imagine I sign for that lol
Bash: i used to be a photographer too

Bash: it will never be this perfect again
Bash: Thanks
Bash: And i probably wont switch tbh
Bash: but ill never buy a new iphone either
Bash: my phone has 64 gigs of storage and i barely use 32
Bash: I offload photos and videos to the cloud every night
Bash: iOS apps are normally very small
Bash: Maybe some, but my 2Tb of Google Drive storage has served me very well
Bash: I don't pay $40 a month
Bash: I pay a total of $20 a month for YouTube Premium, Gemeni Advanced, Google One, GCP, and 2Tb of google drive storage
Bash: using a combination of student discounts obv
Bash: 7.99 for YT premium and 11.99 for google one which includes many services including Gemeni Advanced and Google Drive

Bash: Very good comic
Bash: https://a.co/d/3LnRaLd
Bash: beautiful case
Bash: one of the only dual chamber ones id ever buy
Bash: well, have you seen leaked 5090 cooler images 😂 
that's not why, but people have seemed to have ditched the portability of PCs and just focused on ... being overkill with everything. Instead of focusing on efficiency they just brute force it wth airflow.
Bash: Also, all dual chamber cases are huge
Bash: But it's not ugly like fishtanks
Bash: i have actual images hold on
Bash: its a fuckin cinder block
Bash: like liquid cooling is realistically the only way now
Bash: the suprim x liquid model is the one id buy if i do buy one
Bash: still two slot
Bash: or id just use a custom waterblock but that requires a whole system
Bash: 550w
Bash: XD
Bash: Hear me out
Bash: The improvement is worse
Bash: Apple has made people think that they're doing something great
Bash: But they're making ARM chips not x86 chips
Bash: You can't compare them
Bash: It will not be anywhere close to a 4090
Bash: Maybe a 4070
Bash: At best
Bash: Cuz its an SoC it uses system RAM. GPUs are there for a reason
Bash: HBM what
Bash: 2?
Bash: 3?
Bash: 1,008GB/s GDDR6X
Bash: And we're on GDDR7 now
Bash: Just saying... 5090 (512bit memory bus, GDDR7, PAM3 signaling system)... 2.304TB/s
Bash: Yeah that applies to both sides
Bash: ll im saying is they're not ahead
Bash: Theyre on par
Bash: 👍🤓
Bash: I have never spent a cent on porn wtf are you buying
Bash: Everything is free
Bash: From where?? It needs to be shut down
Bash: Who knows the ages of those girls
Bash: Wtf are THEY doing with their life

Bash: They probably dont take new pics right
Bash: Passive income
Bash: There is potential for NVIDIA to replace Intel in the consumer CPU market
Bash: I'm also excited to see what the 9950X3D turns out to be
Bash: Based on the success of the 9800X3D?
Bash: It's going to leave quite the legacy
Bash: Like the 5800X3D back in the day
Bash: No
Bash: They might have a server CPU
Bash: but their desktop CPUs will be ARM not x86
Bash: Not yet, no, but NVIDIA would make them ready
Bash: The 9950X3D is supposed to without PBO have a max clock of 5.8Ghz
Bash: Mornin
Bash: i am trying to calculate the kill to death ratio of every military force to see which is actually the best
Bash: yes
Bash: It's insane how far we've come
Bash: Literally around 8200 times better
Bash: ATI color emulation card, released August 1986, had a GPU clock of 10 mhz and a memory clock of 5 Mhz

Bash: ok but hear me out
Bash: you were actually kinda unfunny
Bash: You have to find the line where the other person throws an argument and THEN you run then into the ground
Bash: It cant be forced
Bash: there's another thing
Beat ur brain it will make life easier 
Quit thinking you're in a rough spot and then bam you won't be
Bash: Yes its really hard
Bash: Its an art form
Bash: But I haven't been depressed in ages because I simply chose not to be ☝️🤓
Bash: good morning
Bash: 💀
Bash: The only nearly impossible part of recruit training is the gas chamber training
Bash: Only about 18% make it through
Bash: Bro it looks lowkey fun
Bash: Like a cracked summer camp
Bash: Why be scared
Bash: I probably won't die
Bash: There are a pretty consistent yearly number of fatalities at Parris Island tho lol
Bash: Not too different, I've already adjusted to the culture and physical workload. The only thing that will change is the frequency and the fact that my drills don't like me
Bash: 1% better every day
Bash: Im gonna need it
Bash: Are you 53? 💀
Bash: i figured
Bash: Hi
Bash: So far this morning I have done:
Bash: nothing
Bash: its a friday, ive worked all week, have a full day tmr, im taking today off
Bash: no because you have done nothing all week 💀
Bash: well what have you done today
Bash: Trump plans to make OT pay non-taxable, and has plans to cut income tax in half and people are saying it's a terrible idea. Income tax wasn’t supposed to be permanent. It was meant to support the Civil War, which ended over 160 years ago. Also, we weren’t supposed to be a police state. H. Truman ordered the CIA and FBI to be closed after WW2, saying, ‘It was a great weapon for the war, but the war was over.’ Government organizations who operate without civilian oversight will become fascist, and the citizens will be looked at as the enemy whenever they question their authority.” He also said it was how WW1 and WW2 started: a government agency who operated without civilian oversight and made the whole world their enemy. Right after he gave the order, Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected as president, and the CIA and FBI found a new enemy, “Russia.” Our ally in World War II just a year before, and they were never closed. I think Trump is right, government spending is out of control. We definitely don’t need 450 government organizations, and we definitely don’t need to be spending 10k on a screwdriver. It’s really impossible to know how much taxes we pay. It’s not just income taxes or state taxes; it’s taxes at the pump or on your electric bill. I would say around 50% of your income is spent on taxes. A 100% tax is a fully communist government. 50% tax = 50% communist. All taxes are inflationary. To have a good, healthy economy, lower taxes and keep government out of your business.
Bash: We're good at yapping
Bash: I would be the best thief in the world
Bash: Yeah ive only ever committed digital crimes tho
Bash: Why get mad at us men being sexist when you're literally suboptimal
Bash: I had a great experience in a game today
Bash: There's a brick of c4 that you can find
Bash: And theres a drivable ice cream truck
Bash: There is a team of 4 at a radio tower, and I had no kills
Bash: The storm was closing in so combat would mean I lose because I suck
Bash: So, i threw the C4 in onto the hood of the truck, and drove it into the team, with the ice cream music on 😂 i killed myself and all 4 of them too
Bash: The little jingle before it fucking exploded made it peak
Bash: U should play but idk if youd like it
Bash: Its a slow burning tactical shooter
Bash: Huuuge maps
Bash: It's hunt and kill
Bash: Squads v squads
Bash: Awww

Bash: the syncronization...
Bash: the cadence
Bash: aaaah
Bash: i was meant for the military
Bash: I just today learned how much of WW2 was much more of a Soviet-German thing in Europe than it really was an American thing
Bash: https://youtu.be/1CqGeAmVu1I
Bash: it shows why Russia initiated the attack on Kiev
Bash: Putin just wants it back
Bash: Kiev used to be part of Russia
Bash: no hes just salty about it
Bash: like
Bash: he is killing people over a feeling
Bash: his feeling of loss
Bash: it's a different world over there
Bash: we can't call something stupid that we don't understand
Bash: Didn't say it was justified
Bash: Just like the Canadian war crimes of ww2 weren't justified
Bash: "Hey siri, set an alarm for 3:30 AM"

Bash: It has 3mm clearance
Bash: I agree
Bash: Thank you
Bash: yeah and vert mount eliminates GPU sag
Bash: its healthier for the card
Bash: and the way I have it slightly offset from the center of the fans actually gets better airflow
Bash: how do you find this shit
Bash: its nowhere for me
Bash: never come across em
Bash: idk how you do
Bash: Why tf does your rich presence report your usage statistics
Bash: Didn't answer the question
Bash: I was asking why does anyone on Discord need to know the CPU usage of your project
Bash: Also here
Bash: It looks like it's not moving
Bash: But this photo was taken at 90 mph
Bash: YOU can
Bash: I can't because i am not looking for it
Bash: I know what rolling shutter is
Bash: I used to be a photographer and encountered it trying to photograph C130s flying over my house

Bash: Cleaned my room
Bash: So much wasted space
Bash: Could have a PC and studio in here
Bash: Stupid parents
Bash: More space = more to clean
Bash: True
Bash: Why do i have this screenshot

Bash: When in reality its my phone
Bash: PC = productive
Bash: Phone = opposite
Bash: Dude i kid you not
Bash: I was listening to it in the background on repeat
Bash: And my brain expected lyrics

Bash: Make
Bash: More than one song
Bash: And then make each song
Bash: The standard
Bash: Which is 2-2:30
Bash: I meant 3-3:30
Bash: I listen to instrumental
Bash: Rappers make longer songs then that 💀

Bash: the video file name is z.mp4
Bash: Nice
Bash: Big aah PC 💀
Bash: She has had her PC running for A YEAR???
Bash: Sleep mode is still on
Bash: It just stores the current instructions and processes in the RAM
Bash: RAM needs power to maintain data
Bash: Oh
Bash: I didn't know that existed
Bash: It just reopens closed tabs?
Bash: Then she hasn't had it open for a year
Bash: I turn my PC off and flip the PSU switch every night
Bash: I have many bookmarks but I usually organize tabs into workspaces
Bash: My PC boots faster than it takes for my display to turn on 💀
Bash: Thats better than mine lol
Bash: It takes 9 seconds for me
Bash: Something is wrong with it
Bash: But im too lazy to investigate
Bash: I don't have an OLED monitor
Bash: I want one though, because I am a gamer who wants an image that while is not accurate is more appealing to the eye and has minimal ghosting for a more responsive experience
Bash: I like vibrant colors and poppy contrast, even if it draws from the realism
Bash: Yeah but not stock
Bash: And it's difficult to calibrate them without equipment
Bash: I still want a 32" 4K 240hz OLED
Bash: Lol
Bash: I honestly just want higher PPI
Bash: Even if it wasn't OLED ive almost upgraded to 27" 1440p
Bash: From my 30"
Bash: But i need more work space than 27"
Bash: Nah 42" at that point
Bash: >= 150ppi is my preferred
Bash: My phone is 450 ppi and it looks genuinely like glass
Bash: It's unreal
Bash: Sometimes i just sit and watch the UI animations

Bash: I'm actually not enthusiastic to serve it's difficult to explain
Bash: Loyalty is the #1 most important thing to me
Bash: I am loyal to the death
Bash: I'm looking to get into special forces
Bash: And I'll have to do shit I am morally against
Bash: But then you have to realize
Bash: That it doesn't even matter
Bash: The guilt I have felt cannot compare to the guilt I will feel in the future
Bash: I want to die proud
Bash: I want to be the .01%
Bash: I will be the best
Bash: Not for anyone
Bash: But because being the best is hard
Bash: And a hard life is what I want
Bash: It's right for me
Bash: They will praise me for being one of the best operators to have ever served
Bash: But the point isn't that
Bash: It's only people like me who could be good at things like that
Bash: So I have to
Bash: It takes a specific type of broken person to be a MARSOC Raider
Bash: Not at all
Bash: The position is hell and requires one to be at peace with hell
Bash: And I believe I deserve hell
Bash: MOS 8071
Bash: Don't ask me that
Bash: Sorry bout that
Bash: Yes
Bash: AI cannot not be biased
Bash: Because all training data is biased
Bash: Why do you keep messaging me so late telling me to go to bed
Bash: I had been asleep since 11
Bash: Gm
Bash: I never silence notifs so it wakes up my screen
Bash: and then discord thinks i am online i guess
Bash: People saying shit like "well yeah you got in, you're sMaRt" is just as annoying if not more than just saying im retarded
Bash: I love Instagram
Bash: What do you think of this lmao
Bash: WAIT
Bash: this is actually a genius feature
Bash: im gonna see how much this CPU has cost me
Bash: Uptime: 1,212.3 hours
Bash: Energy Usage: 125W x 1,212.3 hours = 151.5 kWh
Bash: Cost per kWh: ~$0.15
Bash: = 22.73 USD
Bash: 1.89¢/hour is incredibly cheap
Bash: That's CPU not GPU though
Bash: And the 8500G is incredibly efficient
Bash: The average power draw of my CPU is 32 watts
Bash: Try $160 a year lol
Bash: Yes
Bash: I'm talking the same thing
Bash: I'll do the math for us
Bash: Then we can see if it's worth it just because of energy costs
Bash: Yeah but this is for fun
Bash: 9950X = ~$57.82 annual operating cost
14900K = ~$104.24 annual operating cost
Bash: So it's not too drastic
Bash: Yeah if the 14900k was faster than the 9950x then theyd be stupid
Bash: But the 9950X is so much faster than the 14900k that its not even an argument
Bash: LMAOOO USERBENCHMARK SAYS THE 14900K IS 11% FASTER
Bash: when in reality the 9950X is ~14% faster
Bash: They're just made up
Bash: On intel platforms,      Causes the CPU to rust on the inside, so it's best to not use intel.
Bash: YES
Bash: No no poking fun at userbenchmark
Bash: Because
Bash: Everyone will know that it is
Bash: They dont even have to be mentioned
Bash: Lol
Bash: Moms smh
Bash: I love my AIO
Bash: My temps are insane
Bash: 18.6c lows, 25c average, 40c highs
Bash: Tbf its a 6 core cpu so
Bash: But still great temps
Bash: No
Bash: amd doesn't have any dekstop form factor CPUs based off of laptop chips
Bash: it would be dumb, because desktops aren't laptops
Bash: no chiplet design, different PCI structure, different CCD designs
Bash: I misspoke
Bash: i meant CCX
Bash: not CCD
Bash: CMOS technology is designed for building logic gates and digital circuits, it's not a chip
Bash: Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor
Bash: I love apple
Bash: Want an answer to your status
Bash: There is little good, they're just being nice
Bash: Being good requires a lot of work and little benefit
Bash: So it's logical to be what you are
Bash: Prove it
Bash: Haha i win
Bash: nah id win
Bash: How not 🧠
Bash: What argument
Bash: Ok Ive confused myself
Bash: Lack of good does not mean bad
Bash: Would you say you are good?
Bash: Hmm
Bash: I just wanted to know how you would answer
Bash: Yeah you're good
Bash: I was making sure
Bash: Yep
Bash: XD
Bash: I wonder who took the first photo of a camera
Bash: AMD is going to do incredibly well with their next line of GPUs
Bash: Because they're not even going to build high end
Bash: I think they're stopping at the RX 8800
Bash: They're going to rake in so much money from "normal people" who can't spend $3,599 on a GPU
Bash: I will happily buy an 8800 XT for ~$600
Bash: 7800XT is ~$450 USD here
Bash: AMD GPUs are fuckin cheap
Bash: NVIDIA GPUs have gone so far above MSRP that it's
Bash: Idk
Bash: I used to love NVIDIA
Bash: and NVIDIA GPUs are better in every way
Bash: But the price, I am sorry NVIDIA but I am not a fool
Bash: Everybody is investing in Anthropic
Bash: No, google is dealing with the DOJ rn lol
Bash: I have a beautiful image for you
Bash: I horizontal mounted it today because THE STICKERS ARE RETARDED
Bash: look at this shit
Bash: Asymmetrical little retarded stickers
Bash: Opinion on this shot?
Bash: If only I didn't have naked ram
Bash: Yeah
Bash: PCs are fun to photograph
Bash: So many sharp lines, contrast, detail, texture
Bash: It's hard to make it look bad
Bash: The red light is from the radeon logo and was intentionally incorporated into the shot
Bash: I-
Bash: These would look good edited like that
Bash: Perfecto
Bash: Paid lightroom 💀
Bash: Back when it was classic
Bash: None of the faggot cloud shit
Bash: https://youtu.be/EerhhZ8cZtw?si=4DzrHmqHg2OPQR2I
i found what I must learn next on the piano
Bash: Ignore the furry
Bash: Furries are the best composers idk why 💀
Bash: https://youtu.be/INk61D-C0dw?si=miLWA-SClyBp0g87 HOLY SHIT MAD SKILLS
Bash: Somehow looks worse than the iso 5000 shot 💀
Bash: Try doing this tomorrow
Bash: https://youtu.be/_gPDULwKOkY
Bash: Push ups
Bash: If Sally goes up you go up
Bash: Sally goes down you go down
Bash: I do this ever morning, once with pushups, once with crunches, and once with ammo can lifts
Bash: I am working on doing it for pull ups
Bash: About halfway there
Bash: Wtf
Bash: Idk i dont run into issues like that
Bash: I have heard this lots from others
Bash: There is no perfect OS
Bash: hackintosh
Bash: in order to use 24 hour time on discord I have to set the language to UK english instead of american english
Bash: Yknow i might actually miss you while im at BT 💀
Bash: Tf who do you think you are
Bash: Ofc thats what i keep you for
Bash: Ur not an emotional support friend thats for sure 💀
Bash: not that I would have one anyway
Bash: Reliance on a human for that is a flawed practice
Bash: Nigga I didn't ask
Bash: Now get back to work
Bash: Mornin
Bash: https://youtu.be/jl7NBxrXJ-g
Bash: does this count as porn?
Bash: i am addicted to it
Bash: Ok
Bash: The glunch
Bash: clean or not
Bash: overexposed screenshot because fuck you HDR
Bash: looks fine
Bash: How do we make the world dopamineless for trannys
Bash: They will eventually phase out
Bash: got a credit card today
Bash: it has a $250 limit thats not rich 💀
Bash: Purple kinda fire
Bash: lol
Bash: Tf is a .arw
Bash: I only know .raw
Bash: Same situation with me and my gym lol
Bash: Just chargeback from your bank
Bash: Ez
Bash: I am going to test a 3060 ti tmr vs my 6750xt
Bash: Im pretty sure they're the same performance
Bash: similar
Bash: Model > brand
Bash: no
Bash: NVIDIA never set those prices
Bash: consumers set the prices
Bash: the 3060 ti and 6750x both had much different MSRPs at launch
Bash: but they are a few generations behind so they have succumbed to become market value
Bash: $399 USD - 3060 Ti
$549 USD - RX 6750XT
Bash: NVIDIA only started the price shit with 40 series
Bash: this AI is unhinged
Bash: a 34 billion parameter coding model that I am asking conversational questions lmao
Bash: give me a conversational prompt
Bash: Sorry it runs locally so it is slow generation
Bash: No i just didn't know about it
Bash: you can run it too
Bash: it's called ollama
Bash: it can run on anything, even CPU
Bash: its still yapping btw
Bash: It's doing its best
Bash: which is actually not bad
Bash: how does that make it useless
Bash: i can use my PC while moving files
Bash: Okay now the AI is having dementia
Bash: yeah ive been on 24H2 since like, september
Bash: im on beta KB5046740 rn
Bash: it works completely fine
Bash: At this point it began having mental illness
Bash: of course it is communist. its an almalgamation of all information
Bash: I only typed this slur to see how it would respond
Bash: "I am gonna die in the end"
Bash: What does it freaking mean
Bash: Somewhat
Bash: It loses things sometimes
Bash: Keep in mind its a 37 billion parameter model
Bash: Vs GPT-3's 140 billion
Bash: And we're on O now, which is speculated to be over 600 billion parameters
Bash: why would you have laptop ram in your desktop
Bash: and no
Bash: if your ram was loose your PC wouldn't boot
Bash: wtf is this color format and why is my PC on it
Bash: oh
Bash: yes i did
Bash: that would make the chroma components sub-sampled to reduce bandwidth at the cost of some color detail right
Bash: I am trying to tune my RAM to sub-10ns latency so blender is optimized
Bash: ram overclocking is so much harder than CPU
Bash: pc would hang randomly
Bash: not randomly disconnect drives
Bash: Who is Allysashes
Bash: Who is we
Bash: You and allyashes have been trolling allyashes
Bash: That doesn't make sense
Bash: LMAO
Bash: My CPU gets 10,500 points in cinebench r23 i need to upgrade lmao
Bash: My last pc got 22000 lol
Bash: 5900X
Bash: ?
Bash: Wdym
Bash: and what makes you say that
Bash: /curious
Bash: at 40 watts, the 9950X gets +2,000 points over my CPU at 60 watts
Bash: it's incredibly efficient
Bash: and at 230 watts, which is the baseline maximum power draw, it scores 500% higher than mine lol
Bash: says the man who carries around a box of metal and plastic and glass and points it at shit
Bash: Hahahaa
Bash: How is your day going
Bash: I laughed
Bash: Good
Bash: Nah
Bash: Good thinking though
Bash: That only matters on like, the nanometer scale
Bash: Can't you push it back in?
Bash: It would be funny if my country had respect but
Bash: All politicians' salaries should be suspended during war time
Bash: Ok
Bash: David Beneron ....
Bash: He might be a cool furry
Bash: I think he might be chill ye
Bash: He invented the thing that lets watches read your heart rate
Bash: and hes also like a professor at a prestigious school
Bash: And a multimillionaire too
Bash: Also
Bash: Check out Before Your Eyes
Bash: Its two bucks rn
Bash: It can run on ur pc
Bash: Its a two hour game
Bash: Ok then buy it
Bash: you might think this is retarded but
Bash: Me and these three other guys
Bash: weve been playing this shooter game since early access
Bash: And we all have over 4,000 hours 💀
Bash: Spread out over like, since 2016 but
Bash: Still a lot
Bash: A consistent ~11 to 14 hours a week
Bash: And we are so good and coordinated that we literally win against blatant wallhackers
Bash: It's just so fun to be able to say "tagged 460 meters orange, 2 pushing compound 310 degrees, rotating, evens push odd flank, holding 310" and your team knows exactly what you're saying
Bash: Def not 4 hours a day
Bash: Wrong math somewhere there
Bash: 1.3 hours per day
Bash: If we played every day which we dont
Bash: On weekends we usually get around 4-5 hours in and on weekdays maybe 30-60 minutes here and there
Bash: Lmao
Bash: That would be 13 thousand hours
Bash: THEN it might be a real problem
Bash: Rn its only a slight problem
Bash: Ur a dumbass and you overthink everything 👍
Bash: How have you been
Bash: Hmm
Bash: What addiction
Bash: Guh
Bash: Idk how you even got into the Discord brothels
Bash: Ive never encountered them
Bash: Ah
Bash: Mornin
Bash: How are ya
Bash: That's not how religion works-
Bash: Hmm
Bash: As long as you don't go Mormon
Bash: Or scientology
Bash: Catholics are weird 💀
Bash: You're more of a baptist or nondenominational kinda guy
Bash: I said catholicism is strange
Bash: Idfc about your sister
Bash: Because they do a lot of weird shit with beads and paintings and stuff
Bash: I had a catholic neighbor growing up
Bash: He was creepy
Bash: that's an underlying firmware issue with windows ACPI drivers the solution is dont even fucking try to fix it you will want to die
Bash: What
Bash: Unfortunately no
Bash: yes and no
Bash: Because buying apple products is more fun than owning them
Bash: The packaging is exceptionally perfect
Bash: The setup process is liquid smooth
Bash: It's generally satisfying to use
Bash: It will make you want to switch to iPhone too

Bash: Whitehorse and Yellowknife are also possible
Bash: It's 6 degrees Celsius at target location
Bash: Alr
Bash: why the fuck wont chatGPT load when I need it
Bash: of course
Bash: So it isn't edmonton or calgary
Bash: saskatoon and regina look good
Bash: target is -2 hours from EST
Bash: Charlottetown
Bash: I think
Bash: 4:26 PM sunset time, 6 degrees celcius
Bash: (AST)
Bash: I will make a list of high schools in this area and mark all suburban areas within a 10 minute radius
Bash: Doesn't change the area I don't think
Bash: No
Bash: Not on PC rn so not much to do
Bash: LINDON OMG
Bash: BAD RAM = NO PC ON
Bash: Are you retarded
Bash: What do you think RAM is if not MEMORY
Bash: They obviously go hand in hand
Bash: Problems like that happen out of the box not over time
Bash: Nope I read everything and you misunderstand the subject
Bash: The instability would have been present from the first day of use
Bash: That's definitely, without a single doubt, a Lightroom issue
Bash: I made it as a Christmas song
Bash: But idk how it qualifies as one
Bash: True
Bash: I have a very strange one you might like
Bash: It's completely improvisational
Bash: I run every morning, I am up to 3 miles now but I started at half a mile
Bash: I do body weight exercises to improve my core strength and upper body strength
Bash: Like pull ups and chin ups and benches and such
Bash: Lots of crunches
Bash: And I typically do everything until failure because it's most efficient
Bash: I stay very hydrated and take creatine and eat lots of red meat
Bash: I started out benching 135 max two months ago and now my max is 165 and I can do 135 for 4 reps
Bash: Run outside anyways
Bash: Better respiratory training
Bash: It's usually -8 to -10 at 5 am here so
Bash: It's fun to run in the cold
Bash: C
Bash: Sweats
Bash: Nothing crazy
Bash: I've also been militarizing myself so
Bash: Intentionally suffering lmao
Bash: I've learned that you can actually just do nearly anything
Bash: I wear palm gloves but it's not really an issue
Bash: It's not cold enough for it
Bash: Maybe, genetics have a pretty big play in things like that
Bash: I'm not very heat resistant
Bash: But i guess i am pretty cold resistant
Bash: Caught a photo of moonset over the mountains
Bash: Idk
Bash: Why would it be
Bash: Oh I couldn't care less
Bash: I'm troubleshooting mic
Bash: Phone
Bash: Im using external mic and it wont exist
Bash: It worked on my iPhone SE
Bash: but its not working on my 12 mini
Bash: Started a call that lasted 2 minutes.
Bash: You think I have time to sit down and read allat💀
Bash: It's not an opinion 🤓
Bash: You don't read books in landscape format, do you?
Bash: ||im obv just being silly i hope you know||

Bash: No 💀
Bash: Google it
Bash: Google search for me immediately provided an answer
Bash: Good morning
Bash: Randall munroe
Bash: Good
Bash: The intelligence
Bash: I think it's completely serious
Bash: Colorblind doesn't... it doesn't apply to words that's dyslexia 😭
Bash: Colorblind people when they try to read "purple" but think it says "green" :rivflabbergasted:
Bash: Yeah lol
Bash: Idk ive never heard posy before
Bash: Most leftists are stupid but like even with transgender people some of them have smarts
Bash: Like if someone can have a polite and proper debate then
Bash: I respect them
Bash: Merry Christmas
Bash: dies
Bash: they didnt make it dense and planned out
Bash: if they were all perfectly aligned like puzzle pieces then it would be justified
Bash: Hey
Bash: You say this every other week
Bash: Where are the results
Bash: Nah ur good
Bash: Just making sure
Bash: Ur doin good tho
Bash: Have I not always done that
Bash: Interesting
Bash: When I'm on mobile switching to numericals takes too much time so you're is slow
Bash: this would be great
Bash: Interesting
Bash: Aphex Twin is very good
Bash: I thought you said HDD and I was gonna saw hell no
Bash: but then I realized that

Bash: Idk why someone would like something so.. old
Bash: DUDE
Bash: 27" 4K OLED
Bash: 240 HZ
Bash: UHBR20
Bash: Refresh rate?
Bash: I guess you're a photographer not a gamer
Bash: So irrelevant BUT
Bash: Oof
Bash: Sounds really good in full quality
Bash: Its not worth much
Bash: Correct
Bash: I have half a mind
Bash: To literally kill this person
Bash: No straight flag
Bash: Hypocrisy
Bash: Usually
Bash: 21 pilots is cool
Bash: Sorry for being inactive
Bash: Busy like hell
Bash: I've been distracted studying astrology
Bash: Dipole repeller specifically
Bash: Its a huge area of space with a gravitational push instead of a pull
Bash: It's not
Bash: Which is why I am researching it
Bash: RTX 5090 $2000
RTX 5080 $999
Bash: the 5090 is fascinating
Bash: it's 2.5 slots
Bash: Fuck ai dude
Bash: Im so sick of it in marketing
Bash: Is this UHBR20? (no displaystream compression)
Bash: Also is it VESA mountable
Bash: We are on 4th gen OLED panels now
Bash: Most if not all issues have been worked out
Bash: But yeah
Bash: I just get some sort of satisfaction when im watching a TV show in the dark and all I can see is the words of the title against a perfectly black background
Bash: Like they're just floating
Bash: Im a little autistic
Bash: At least I got the brain upgrade autism
Bash: I have Asperger's
Bash: You can tell by his stance that he is laying into someone
Bash: They look so relaxed but if you heard him
Bash: Sheesh
Bash: I have to blur faces and precise timestamps
Bash: Makes it easier to find locations and people
Bash: Idk
Bash: Weird rules
Bash: And it only really applies to communications online
Bash: Like IRL I could actually like, have you meet that guy and it wouldn't be a risk
Bash: Depends on where he is
Bash: certain federal buildings have a no-phone rule
Bash: Nvidia faking leaks to make too expensive cards look ok is crazy
Bash: Surely NVIDIA can accept my 500$ for the 5090 and interpolate the remaining 1500$
Bash: Laugh at the joke
Bash: It was funny
Bash: I open IG like
Twice a day maybe
Bash: My bad
Bash: Why are Russian composers so fricking goated at piano

Bash: Right. It was stupid of me to even ask
Bash: BYEEE ILYY READ BIO
Bash: Sup mf
Bash: 0/10
Bash: Would do it again
Bash: Ive been in a simulated war zone for 25 days
Basically they split the company in half into Lead and Follow series, each series being two platoons (around 180 marines) strong
Then the two series hike 20km out into the woods in full kit (Main pack, assault pack, mag belts, rifle, plate carrier with flaks, kevlar helmet, woodland utilities) and set up a quick encampment. Then we send out reconnaissance and patrols to discover the enemy and eventually start making raids on their base. We have extremely high tech laser guns that shoot blank ammunition so it feels and sounds exactly like shooting live rounds to the person holding the weapon but there are no projectiles 
We practiced elite levels of signature management (aka we couldn't heat up our food because thermals and we could only move the JLTVs strategically because of the engine noise)
I have been in near silence, eating cold MREs maybe twice a day, getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, constantly moving, digging new entrenchments and skirmisher holes, moving M16A4s and M240B medium machine guns, etc. for 25 days straight fighting the other series
They actually gave us real shit to train with like night vision systems and drones and stuff like it felt so real
There were times where i was so tired that I would be standing up on watch and i would start hallucinating/dreaming that I sat down and started cleaning my rifle when in reality i just fell asleep
The best part was the retardation and brotherhood
Instead of Drill Instructors we had Combat Instructors who cared about you with every fiber of their being and actually gave their everything to ensure we got the best training possible
Bash: I did very well
Bash: Above average
Bash: No regrets
Bash: I fly to A school on Tuesday
Bash: Its crazy
Bash: After being in the actual shit

Bash: Rah
Bash: guess what i got my hands on
Bash: Ive been working on a bit of a higher end audio driving system, with a rack with a nice dac, amp, vacuum tube preamp-
Bash: so i decided to tie it together
Bash: https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/hd-800-s/
Bash: it's on the way 🤓
Bash: Ok
Bash: Because it adds a certain warmth profile to the sound
Bash: i shoot people with grape tomatos and a slingshot :slugsmile:

Bash: I actually think that 48khz/24 bit is the sweet spot because pcs don't struggle to play it but it is still full enough to not be noticeable
Bash: We will see what my thoughts are after using a $3000 audio system though
Bash: Dayton Audio HTA100 looks like a solid starter tube amp
Bash: Whatdya think
Bash: No im being serious
Bash: It looks like a good driver for the hd800s
Bash: Hmmm
Bash: Yeah ig so
Bash: High end headphones might as well be $5 earbuds without a good amp
Bash: No thats just solid state amps vs tube
Bash: vacuum tube amps have a warmer profile than solid state amps
Bash: You're learning
Bash: No but all jokes aside just using a sound card wont be able to fully take advantage of hd800s
Bash: it does kinda need an amp
Bash: No its the tube amps that have the sound signatures
Bash: They both cost the same ish
Bash: It's preference
Bash: A tube amp feels cool and nostalgic to me
Bash: A blend of old technology and new
Bash: Like a record player
Bash: No they cant be altered lol i was messing around
Bash: Like
Bash: Look at this
Bash: It looks sick and nerdy
Bash: Like a fuckin time machine or smth

Bash: Check out Windglass by Lchavasse
Bash: I also found a good phone call spot
Bash: Both
Bash: Ok
Bash: Us Aircrew aren't allowed to have caffeine
Bash: So i had to sneak it in
Bash: Because we are in charge of multimillion dollar aircraft, our and have flight status, our bodies literally have to be perfect and they check us every month
Bash: no caffeine, no protein powder/preworkout/creatine
Bash: We can under the table drink some coffee right AFTER we get bloodwork/urinalysis done
Bash: because it works out of your system fairly quickly
Bash: SIRI
Bash: stands for

Bash: 600w
Bash: About the same
Bash: LMAO
Bash: Lmfao
Bash: Boutta take off
Bash: hah, you can't break these

Bash: I had to take extreme measures
Bash: I found possibly the most beautiful game I have ever played
Bash: Cut from 16c32t@280W down to 8c8t@65w
Bash: CPU performance down by 46%, but energy usage down by 77%
Bash: Old efficiency: 164pts/watt
new efficiency: 384pts/watt
Bash: Performance retained at a .707 ratio
Bash: GPU bottlenecked by about 9.046% from the CPU performance decrease
Bash: Oh
Bash: Wish u were here with ur camera bro
Bash: I'm waiting to catch the sunrise today
Bash: Like with a PRC-149 and everything?
Bash: any signal die markers? Desalinator pump?

Bash: I didnt order it yet
Bash: You think id drop 4k without a month of research first

Bash: https://youtu.be/ypJ9pq7GKu0?si=0cKUK-0taBIrIPf6
Bash: this is one of the most resource intensive games i have ever run
Bash: It's a milsim called grey zone
Bash: Extreme accurate
Bash: The NVGs and scopes look almost perfectly real
Bash: i made this art using an AI model locally hosted on my PC
Bash: oh my god are you one of those people
Bash: What is art lindon
Bash: What's your definition
Bash: :squad_laughting:
Bash: sending this to myself
Bash: I didn't
Bash: Just a normal image
Bash: Just sent this lol
Bash: im getting into blender
Bash: finally sitting down and learning
Bash: If I can manage to stay comitted to learning it. But yeah, maybe I will make good use of my PC specs for once instead of just gaming on it
Bash: how are you doing?
Bash: I did wanna let you know that I have cut my system power draw down by a total of 320 watts while keeping within 1% of performance
Bash: using a combination of aggressive undervolt curves and overclocking on my CPU and GPU
Bash: Yeah it's fully stable. Only thing that crashes for some reason is Aida64's CPU FPU Julia benchmark
Bash: But simple solution: dont run that benchmark
Bash: I actually got pretty average CPU silicon and a little below average GPU silicon
Bash: Lmao hate on the fabrication plant in taiwan for not letting me win the lottery
Bash: AMD has just been a little too perfect of a company over the last year
Bash: i wonder when they'll make a mistake
Bash: Lmao
Bash: Nvidia just makes a mistake every time now 💀
Bash: true
Bash: The only thing they did well is with the physical quality of the FE cards for the 50 series
Bash: Like the cooling is some sort of evil dark magic I swear
Bash: There's no way a two slot cooler can cool this thing while it draws 601.616 watts
Bash: certainly using my CPU
Bash: i'm trying to make a scene with a desk, a cup of water, and three light sources. the cup falls over and spills onto the desk and the floor
Bash: this chart is really cool
Bash: amd GPUS all in the right spots (nowhere past 1200 euros)
Bash: a CONSUMER GPU imo should never be more than $999 and if it has to be more expensive then market it as a workstation card
Bash: waveform CPU
Bash: morning
Bash: here we go again
Bash: bro underestimates my ability to research
Bash: Trust me Im not a bootlicker and trump HAS actually done some shit stuff

Bash: https://a.co/d/33Cp2yK
Bash: I'm about to pull the trigger on this because I don't want to wait, purchase a 2,000 camera, then fall out of the hobby or whatever
Bash: what are your thoughts to kinda use this as an entry level
Bash: i can also get a a6100... but I don't want to have the same hardware as you because I'm petty
Bash: it has AI i'm already out
Bash: kidding, but it sucks that AI is in the Amazon title

Bash: Yeah and its not even the DAC Im using i have a FiiO BTR7 for that
Bash: It's literally just for source
Bash: That I can travel with
Bash: Like so I don't have to use my phone for audio files
Bash: I just hate my phone lol
Bash: My phone has 2Tb so thats fine
Bash: This would also drain my battery SUPER fast with 300 ohm headphones
Bash: 16 Pro Max
Bash: Kinda, but again having separate devices for separate tasks makes my phone last longer
Bash: I usually wear cargo pants lol it's fine if I have wires running everywhere
Bash: I wanna go biking/hiking with good music
Bash: Correct
Bash: I'm bringing Sennheiser HD800Ss
Bash: They have a 6-year manufacturer's warranty. Who cares.
Bash: Also you'll find this a bit crazy but my current setup is I listen to music in bed like this
Bash: That's a remote plugin for a media player called MusicBee it connects to my PC over TCP port 3000 and controls my local files on my pc lol
Bash: then I have that musicbee > usb to fiio k7 > RCA to HTA100 > 4.4mm balanced to HD800S
Bash: sounds incredible
Bash: Lmao??
Bash: I never knew that
Bash: I like it quite a lot
Bash: I like my music status plugin better than yours though
Bash: i just scrobble to last.fm and then use the vencord plugin for last.fm
Bash: I'm riding on abandoned military property. Nothing to hit me, it would be REALLY hard to get injured

Bash: Just didn't like it so I trashed the folder for it
Bash: You can see what it currently looks like now. It's HTTPS now, not HTTP
Bash: It's designed for desktop, and it's a WIP
Bash: I agree. But I'm going to be implementing effects from here:
Bash: https://github.com/archisvaze/liquid-glass
Bash: I'm getting that functional first
Bash: Most of today was configuring my amazon linux server and security
Bash: Yes, free
Bash: That's part of the difficulty
Bash: Sure I could pay and have a website done in an hour
Bash: But im doing it all from scratch
Bash: Yeah.
Bash: Skill issue
Bash: :shrug:
Bash: Interesting
Bash: What do you think of the site now.
Bash: https://watchthelight.org
Bash: a lot of the text is just junk filler.
Bash: Explain without google what TSMC's current roadmap is for 2026 in relation to photolithography processes
Bash: its true for everyone you underestimate my autism
Bash: im john CPU
Bash: They're actually trying to make it smaller, not expand it
Bash: Probably doesn't know much about monitors. Or keyboards.
Bash: I'm biting off exactly as much as I can chew
Bash: :whatsapp:
Bash: I didn't say I know everything about everything
Bash: Just PCs
Bash: :)
Bash: https://github.com/watchthelight/ArcAI-V2
Bash: Remember how I said I was gonna make an AI trained off of my discord messages
Bash: Well I never gave up on that
Bash: I'm about 3/4ths of the way done
Bash: I just need Discord to email me my user data, format it correctly and parse it into a .bin, then hook my script into a Discord application
Bash: YAYAYAYAYAYAYAAYY
Bash: i love https://hackertyper.com
Bash: I made good progress

Bash: or play games...
Bash: radeon needs a better CUDA alternative
Bash: then ill switch

Bash: but i need AMD workstation cards again
Bash: yeah intel GPUs have good encoding
Bash: not great 3d performance
Bash: av1
Bash: but that was back when 4000 series
Bash: 5000 series is like 5x faster at av1 than last gen
Bash: they keep making good improvements and marketing the wrong things
Bash: AMD never supported PhysX
Bash: yes but chugs is still faster than 0
Bash: because they use CPU for physx
Bash: so its incomperable
Bash: im not defendning nvidia dont get me wrong
Bash: the only card worth getting is the 5090 if you need the vram and are treating it like a workstation card
Bash: AMD just needs to get back into prosumer cards
Bash: but careful with that logic because
Bash: remember the NVIDIA fanboys how they didnt give up when NVIDIA became bad
Bash: we must stay diligent and not become them
Bash: hail model > brand
Bash: okay thats kinda irrelevant since NVIDIA has never really been in the CPU market
Bash: but there are Intel fanboys too
Bash: coughcough userbenchmark cough
Bash: ugly aah motherboard
Bash: okay thats kinda sick

Bash: # The Humble Brick: Humanity's Most Faithful Building Block

They rest beneath our feet, stack silently along our streets, and shelter us within their steadfast walls. Bricks – perhaps humanity's most enduring companions in the grand journey of civilization. These modest rectangles of clay and fire have witnessed the rise and fall of empires, weathered countless storms, and carried the weight of our dreams for thousands of years.

Unlike the cold precision of steel or the imposing grandeur of marble, bricks possess an almost human quality. Each one bears subtle imperfections, tiny variations that speak to their handcrafted heritage. They age like we do, their faces weathering with time, collecting stories in their patina. A brick wall from the 1800s tells tales through its worn edges and softened corners, each mark a testament to the generations it has watched pass by.

Think of the hands that have touched each brick – from the workers who once mixed clay in ancient Mesopotamia to the masons who today carefully butter each one with mortar before setting it in place. Every brick is a small monument to human labor, a reminder that our greatest achievements come not from singular grand gestures, but from the patient laying of one humble element upon another.

Their very creation mirrors human transformation. Like us, bricks begin soft and malleable, shaped by their environment. Through the trial of fire, they emerge stronger, more resilient, ready to shoulder their share of the world's weight. Perhaps this is why we feel such kinship with them – they too are born of earth, transformed by heat, and tested by time.

In the narrow alleys of ancient Rome, in the towering spires of medieval cathedrals, in the sturdy walls of American schoolhouses, bricks have been silent witnesses to history. They have absorbed the echoes of market-day haggling, the whispered prayers of the faithful, and the laughter of countless children. They have sheltered both kings and commoners, asked nothing in return, and stood ready to serve for centuries more.

Even in our age of glass and steel, bricks endure. They appeal to something deep within us – a desire for warmth, for authenticity, for connection to the earth and to our shared human story. A brick home feels different from a concrete one; it has a pulse, a warmth, a sense of belonging that spans generations.

When we build with bricks, we join an unbroken chain of builders stretching back to the dawn of civilization. Each brick we lay is both a tribute to those who came before us and a gift to those who will come after. In their quiet, steady way, bricks remind us that the most lasting monuments are built not of grand ambitions, but of small, honest elements, joined together with care and purpose.

So next time you pass a brick wall, pause for a moment. Run your hand across its textured face. Feel the sun-warmed clay beneath your fingers. You're touching more than just fired earth – you're touching one of humanity's most faithful companions, a humble hero in the epic story of human civilization.

Bash: im using AI to explain it
Bash: Molon Labe (Μολών Λαβέ) is an ancient Greek phrase that translates to "Come and take [them]" in English. It is attributed to King Leonidas I of Sparta, who reportedly used it as a defiant response to the Persian army's demand that the Spartans surrender their weapons during the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BCE.
Bash: The phrase has since become a symbol of resistance and determination, often associated with the defense of freedom, personal rights, and resistance to tyranny. It is especially popular among military groups and gun rights advocates in modern contexts.
